 E OF  WAR.


No one  have believed   last years   nineteenth century
  world was being watched keenly  closely by intelligences
greater than man’s  yet  mortal  his own;   men busied
themselves about  various concerns   scrutinised 
studied, perhaps almost  narrowly  a man  a microscope might
scrutinise  transient creatures  swarm  multiply  a drop

about  little affairs, serene   assurance   empire

 same. No one gave a thought   older worlds  space  sources

 mental habits  those departed days.  most terrestrial men
fancied  might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior

plans against us.  early   twentieth century came  great

Yet  vain  man,   blinded by his vanity,  no writer, up

intelligent life might have developed  far,  indeed  all,
beyond  earthly level. Nor was  generally understood  since

  not only more distant  time’s beginning but nearer  end.

 before we judge   too harshly we must remember what ruthless
 utter destruction our own species has wrought, not only upon
animals, such   vanished bison   dodo, but upon  inferior
races.  Tasmanians,  spite   human likeness,  entirely
swept out  existence  a war  extermination waged by European
immigrants,   space  fifty years. Are we such apostles  mercy
  complain if  Martians warred   same spirit?

 Martians seem  have calculated  descent  amazing
subtlety— mathematical learning  evidently far  excess 
ours—  have carried out  preparations  a well-nigh
perfect unanimity. Had our instruments permitted , we might have seen
 gathering trouble far back   nineteenth century. Men like
Schiaparelli watched  red planet—  odd, by--bye,  
countless centuries Mars has been  star  war—but failed 
interpret  fluctuating appearances   markings  mapped 
well. All  time  Martians must have been getting ready.

During  opposition  1894 a great light was seen on  illuminated
part   disk, first   Lick Observatory, then by Perrotin 
Nice,  then by other observers. English readers heard   first 
 issue  _Nature_ dated August 2. I  inclined  think  
blaze may have been  casting   huge gun,   vast pit sunk
in  planet,  which  shots  fired  us. Peculiar
markings,  yet unexplained,  seen near  site   outbreak

incandescent gas upon  planet.  had occurred towards midnight 
 twelfth;   spectroscope,  which he had  once resorted,
indicated a mass  flaming gas, chiefly hydrogen, moving  
enormous velocity towards  earth.  jet  fire had become
invisible about a quarter past twelve. He compared   a colossal
puff  flame suddenly  violently squirted out   planet, “
flaming gases rushed out  a gun.”

A singularly appropriate phrase  proved. Yet  next day  was

Telegraph_,   world went  ignorance  one   gravest
dangers  ever threatened  human race. I might not have heard

 spite  all  has happened since, I still remember  vigil
very distinctly:  black  silent observatory,  shadowed lantern
throwing a feeble glow upon  floor   corner,  steady ticking

oblong profundity   stardust streaked across . Ogilvy moved
about, invisible but audible. Looking through  telescope, one saw a
circle  deep blue   little round planet swimming   field.

millions  miles  was  us—more than forty millions  miles

Near    field, I remember,  three faint points  light,
three telescopic stars infinitely remote,  all around  was 
unfathomable darkness  empty space. You know how  blackness looks
on a frosty starlight night.  a telescope  seems far profounder.

on earth dreamed   unerring missile.

 night, too,  was another jetting out  gas   distant

told Ogilvy  he took  place.  night was warm  I was thirsty,
 I went stretching  legs clumsily  feeling  way  
darkness,   little table where  siphon stood, while Ogilvy
exclaimed   streamer  gas  came out towards us.

 night another invisible missile started on  way   earth
 Mars, just a second   under twenty-four hours after  first
one. I remember how I sat on  table    blackness, 
patches  green  crimson swimming before  eyes. I wished I had a
light  smoke by, little suspecting  meaning   minute gleam I
had seen  all    presently bring . Ogilvy watched till
one,  then gave  up;  we lit  lantern  walked over  his
house. Down below   darkness  Ottershaw  Chertsey  all

He was full  speculation  night about  condition  Mars, 
scoffed   vulgar idea   having inhabitants who 
signalling us. His idea was  meteorites might be falling  a heavy
shower upon  planet,   a huge volcanic explosion was 
progress. He pointed out   how unlikely  was  organic

“ chances against anything manlike on Mars are a million  one,” he
said.

Hundreds  observers saw  flame  night   night after

Martians inconvenience. Dense clouds  smoke  dust, visible through
a powerful telescope on earth  little grey, fluctuating patches,
spread through  clearness   planet’s atmosphere  obscured

Even  daily papers woke up   disturbances  last,  popular
notes appeared here, ,  everywhere concerning  volcanoes

use     political cartoon. , all unsuspected, those
missiles  Martians had fired  us drew earthward, rushing now  a
pace  many miles a second through  empty gulf  space, hour by

 FALLING STAR.


Then came  night   first falling star.  was seen early  
morning, rushing over Winchester eastward, a line  flame high  
atmosphere. Hundreds must have seen ,  taken    ordinary
falling star. Albin described   leaving a greenish streak behind 
 glowed  some seconds. Denning, our greatest authority on
meteorites, stated   height   first appearance was about
ninety  one hundred miles.  seemed  him   fell  earth
about one hundred miles east  him.

I was  home   hour  writing   study;  although 
French windows face towards Ottershaw   blind was up ( I loved
 those days  look up   night sky), I saw nothing  . Yet
 strangest  all things  ever came  earth  outer space
must have fallen while I was sitting , visible   had I only
looked up   passed. Some  those who saw  flight say 
travelled  a hissing sound. I myself heard nothing  . Many
people  Berkshire, Surrey,  Middlesex must have seen  fall 
, ,  most, have thought  another meteorite had descended. No
one seems  have troubled  look   fallen mass  night.

But very early   morning poor Ogilvy, who had seen  shooting
star  who was persuaded  a meteorite lay somewhere on  common
between Horsell, Ottershaw,  Woking, rose early   idea 
finding . Find  he did, soon after dawn,  not far  
s-pits.  enormous hole had been made by  impact  
projectile,   s  gravel had been flung violently  every
direction over  heath, forming heaps visible a mile  a half away.
 heather was on fire eastward,  a thin blue smoke rose against
 dawn.

 Thing itself lay almost entirely buried  s, amidst 
scattered splinters  a fir tree  had shivered  fragments  
descent.  uncovered part had  appearance  a huge cylinder,
caked over   outline softened by a thick scaly dun-coloured
incrustation.  had a diameter  about thirty yards. He approached
 mass, surprised   size  more    shape, since most
meteorites are rounded more  less completely.  was, however, still
 hot   flight through  air   forbid his near approach.
A stirring noise within  cylinder he ascribed   unequal cooling
  surface;    time  had not occurred  him  
might be hollow.

He remained standing   edge   pit   Thing had made 
itself, staring   strange appearance, astonished chiefly  
unusual shape  colour,  dimly perceiving even then some evidence
 design   arrival.  early morning was wonderfully still, 
 sun, just clearing  pine trees towards Weybridge, was already
warm. He did not remember hearing any birds  morning,  was
certainly no breeze stirring,   only sounds   faint
movements  within  cindery cylinder. He was all alone on 
common.

Then suddenly he noticed  a start  some   grey clinker,
 ashy incrustation  covered  meteorite, was falling off 
circular edge   end.  was dropping off  flakes  raining
down upon  s. A large piece suddenly came off  fell  a
sharp noise  brought his heart in his mouth.

 a minute he scarcely realised what  meant, , although 
heat was excessive, he clambered down in  pit close   bulk 
see  Thing more clearly. He fancied even then   cooling 
 body might account  , but what disturbed  idea was 
fact   ash was falling only   end   cylinder.

 then he perceived , very slowly,  circular top  
cylinder was rotating on  body.  was such a gradual movement 
he discovered  only through noticing  a black mark  had been
near him five minutes ago was now   other side  
circumference. Even then he scarcely understood what  indicated,
until he heard a muffled grating sound  saw  black mark jerk
forward  inch  . Then  thing came upon him  a flash. 
cylinder was artificial—hollow—  end  screwed out! Something
within  cylinder was unscrewing  top!

“Good heavens!” said Ogilvy. “’s a man  —men  ! Half
roasted  death! Trying  escape!”

 once,  a quick mental leap, he linked  Thing   flash
upon Mars.

 thought   confined creature was  dreadful  him  he
forgot  heat  went forward   cylinder  help turn. But
luckily  dull radiation arrested him before he  burn his hands
on  still-glowing metal.   he stood irresolute  a moment,
then turned, scrambled out   pit,  set off running wildly in
Woking.  time then must have been somewhere about six o’clock. He
met a waggoner  tried  make him underst, but  tale he told

“Henderson,” he called, “you saw  shooting star last night?”

“Well?” said Henderson.

“’s out on Horsell Common now.”

“Good Lord!” said Henderson. “Fallen meteorite! ’s good.”

“But ’s something more than a meteorite. ’s a cylinder—
artificial cylinder, man!  ’s something inside.”

Henderson stood up  his spade  his h.

“What’s ?” he said. He was deaf  one ear.

Ogilvy told him all  he had seen. Henderson was a minute  
taking  . Then he dropped his spade, snatched up his jacket, 
came out in  road.  two men hurried back  once   common,
 found  cylinder still lying   same position. But now 
sounds inside had ceased,  a thin circle  bright metal showed
between  top   body   cylinder. Air was either entering

quarter  nine when I went out  get  _Daily Chronicle_. I was
naturally startled,  lost no time  going out  across 
Ottershaw bridge   s-pits.





ON HORSELL COMMON.


I found a little crowd  perhaps twenty people surrounding  huge
hole  which  cylinder lay. I have already described  appearance
  colossal bulk, embedded   ground.  turf  gravel
about  seemed charred  if by a sudden explosion. No doubt 
impact had caused a flash  fire. Henderson  Ogilvy  not .
I think  perceived  nothing was  be done   present, 
had gone away  breakfast  Henderson’s house.

  four  five boys sitting on  edge   Pit,  
feet dangling,  amusing themselves—until I stopped —by throwing
stones   giant mass. After I had spoken   about , 
began playing  “touch”   out   group  bystanders.

Among these  a couple  cyclists, a jobbing gardener I employed
sometimes, a girl carrying a baby, Gregg  butcher  his little
boy,  two  three loafers  golf caddies who  accustomed 
hang about  railway station.  was very little talking. Few 
 common people  Engl had anything but  vaguest astronomical
ideas  those days. Most    staring quietly   big table
like end   cylinder, which was still  Ogilvy  Henderson had
left . I fancy  popular expectation  a heap  charred corpses
was disappointed   inanimate bulk. Some went away while I was
,  other people came. I clambered in  pit  fancied I
heard a faint movement under  feet.  top had certainly ceased 
rotate.

 was only when I got thus close     strangeness  
object was  all evident  .   first glance  was really no
more exciting than  overturned carriage  a tree blown across 
road. Not  much , indeed.  looked like a rusty gas float.

 Ogilvy, I still believed    men  Mars.  mind ran
fancifully on  possibilities   containing manuscript, on 
difficulties  translation  might arise, whether we  find
coins  models  ,   forth. Yet  was a little too large 
assurance on  idea. I felt  impatience  see  opened. About
eleven,  nothing seemed happening, I walked back, full  such
thought,   home  Maybury. But I found  difficult  get  work
upon  abstract investigations.

  afternoon  appearance   common had altered very much.

had roused every observatory   three kingdoms.

rather lordly carriage. Besides ,  was quite a heap 
bicycles.  addition, a large number  people must have walked, 
spite   heat   day,  Woking  Chertsey,   
was altogether quite a considerable crowd—one  two gaily dressed
ladies among  others.

 was glaringly hot, not a cloud   sky nor a breath  wind, 
 only shadow was    few scattered pine trees.  burning
heather had been extinguished, but  level ground towards Ottershaw
was blackened  far  one  see,  still giving off vertical
streamers  smoke.  enterprising sweet-stuff dealer   Chobham
Road had sent up his son  a barrow-load  green apples  ginger
beer.

Going   edge   pit, I found  occupied by a group  about
half a dozen men—Henderson, Ogilvy,  a tall, fair-haired man  I
afterwards learned was Stent,  Astronomer Royal,  several
workmen wielding spades  pickaxes. Stent was giving directions  a
clear, high-pitched voice. He was standing on  cylinder, which was
now evidently much cooler; his face was crimson  streaming 
perspiration,  something seemed  have irritated him.

A large portion   cylinder had been uncovered, though  lower
end was still embedded.  soon  Ogilvy saw  among  staring
crowd on  edge   pit he called    come down,  asked 
if I  mind going over  see Lord Hilton,  lord   manor.

 growing crowd, he said, was becoming a serious impediment  
excavations, especially  boys.  wanted a light railing put up,
 help  keep  people back. He told   a faint stirring was
occasionally still audible within  case, but   workmen had
failed  unscrew  top,   afforded no grip  .  case
appeared  be enormously thick,   was possible   faint
sounds we heard represented a noisy tumult   interior.

I was very glad  do  he asked,   become one   privileged
spectators within  contemplated enclosure. I failed  find Lord
Hilton  his house, but I was told he was expected  London by 
six o’clock train  Waterloo;    was then about a quarter
past five, I went home, had some tea,  walked up   station 
waylay him.





 CYLINDER OPENS.


When I returned   common  sun was setting. Scattered groups
 hurrying   direction  Woking,  one  two persons 
returning.  crowd about  pit had increased,  stood out black
against  lemon yellow   sky—a couple  hundred people,
perhaps.   raised voices,  some sort  struggle appeared
 be going on about  pit. Strange imaginings passed through 
mind.  I drew nearer I heard Stent’s voice:

“Keep back! Keep back!”

A boy came running towards .

“’s a-movin’,” he said    he passed; “a-screwin’  a-screwin’
out. I don’t like . I’m a-goin’ ’ome, I .”

I went on   crowd.   really, I  think, two  three
hundred people elbowing  jostling one another,  one  two ladies
 being by no means  least active.

“He’s fallen   pit!” cried some one.

“Keep back!” said several.

 crowd swayed a little,  I elbowed  way through. Every one
seemed greatly excited. I heard a peculiar humming sound   pit.

“I say!” said Ogilvy; “help keep these idiots back. We don’t know
what’s   confounded thing, you know!”

I saw a young man, a shop assistant  Woking I believe he was,
standing on  cylinder  trying  scramble out   hole again.
 crowd had pushed him .

 end   cylinder was being screwed out  within. Nearly two
feet  shining screw projected. Somebody blundered against ,  I
narrowly missed being pitched on  top   screw. I turned, 
 I did   screw must have come out,   lid   cylinder
fell upon  gravel  a ringing concussion. I stuck  elbow in
 person behind ,  turned  head towards  Thing again.  a
moment  circular cavity seemed perfectly black. I had  sunset 
 eyes.

I think everyone expected  see a man emerge—possibly something a
little unlike us terrestrial men, but  all essentials a man. I know I
did. But, looking, I presently saw something stirring within 
shadow: greyish billowy movements, one above another,  then two
luminous disks—like eyes. Then something resembling a little grey
snake, about  thickness  a walking stick, coiled up out  
writhing middle,  wriggled   air towards — then another.

A sudden chill came over .  was a loud shriek  a woman
behind. I half turned, keeping  eyes fixed upon  cylinder still,
 which other tentacles  now projecting,  began pushing 
way back   edge   pit. I saw astonishment giving place 
horror on  faces   people about . I heard inarticulate
exclamations on all sides.  was a general movement backwards. I
saw  shopman struggling still on  edge   pit. I found myself
alone,  saw  people on  other side   pit running off,
Stent among . I looked again   cylinder,  ungovernable
terror gripped . I stood petrified  staring.

A big greyish rounded bulk,  size, perhaps,  a bear, was rising
slowly  painfully out   cylinder.   bulged up  caught
 light,  glistened like wet leather.

Two large dark-coloured eyes  regarding  steadfastly.  mass
 framed ,  head   thing, was rounded,  had, one
might say, a face.  was a mouth under  eyes,  lipless brim
 which quivered  panted,  dropped saliva.  whole creature
heaved  pulsated convulsively. A lank tentacular appendage gripped
 edge   cylinder, another swayed   air.

Those who have never seen a living Martian can scarcely imagine 
strange horror   appearance.  peculiar shaped mouth  
pointed upper lip,  absence  brow ridges,  absence  a chin
beneath  wedgelike lower lip,  incessant quivering   mouth,
 Gorgon groups  tentacles,  tumultuous breathing   lungs
 a strange atmosphere,  evident heaviness  painfulness 
movement due   greater gravitational energy   earth—above
all,  extraordinary intensity   immense eyes—  once
vital, intense, inhuman, crippled  monstrous.  was something
fungoid   oily brown skin, something   clumsy deliberation 
 tedious movements unspeakably nasty. Even   first encounter,
 first glimpse, I was overcome  disgust  dread.

Suddenly  monster vanished.  had toppled over  brim  
cylinder  fallen in  pit,  a thud like  fall  a great
mass  leather. I heard  give a peculiar thick cry,  forth
another  these creatures appeared darkly   deep shadow  
aperture.

I turned , running madly, made   first group  trees, perhaps
a hundred yards away; but I ran slantingly  stumbling,  I 
not avert  face  these things.

, among some young pine trees  furze bushes, I stopped,
panting,  waited further developments.  common round 
s-pits was dotted  people, standing like myself  a
half-fascinated terror, staring  these creatures,  rather  
heaped gravel   edge   pit  which  lay.  then, 
a renewed horror, I saw a round, black object bobbing up  down on
 edge   pit.  was  head   shopman who had fallen ,
but showing  a little black object against  hot western sun. Now
he got his shoulder  knee up,  again he seemed  slip back until
only his head was visible. Suddenly he vanished,  I  have
fancied a faint shriek had reached . I had a momentary impulse  go
back  help him   fears overruled.

Everything was then quite invisible, hidden by  deep pit  
heap  s   fall   cylinder had made. Anyone coming
along  road  Chobham  Woking  have been amazed  
sight—a dwindling multitude  perhaps a hundred people  more
standing  a great irregular circle,  ditches, behind bushes, behind
gates  hedges, saying little  one another    short,
excited shouts,  staring, staring hard  a few heaps  s.

 HEAT-RAY.


After  glimpse I had had   Martians emerging   cylinder
 which  had come   earth   planet, a kind 
fascination paralysed  actions. I remained standing knee-deep  
heather, staring   mound  hid . I was a battleground 
fear  curiosity.

I did not dare  go back towards  pit, but I felt a passionate
longing  peer in . I began walking, therefore,  a big curve,
seeking some point  vantage  continually looking   s-heaps
 hid these new-comers  our earth. Once a leash  thin black
whips, like  arms   octopus, flashed across  sunset  was
immediately withdrawn,  afterwards a thin rod rose up, joint by
joint, bearing   apex a circular disk  spun  a wobbling
motion. What  be going on ?

Most   spectators had gathered  one  two groups—one a little
crowd towards Woking,  other a knot  people   direction 
Chobham. Evidently  shared  mental conflict.   few near
. One man I approached—he was, I perceived, a neighbour  mine,
though I did not know his name— accosted. But  was scarcely a time
 articulate conversation.

“What ugly _brutes_!” he said. “Good God! What ugly brutes!” He
repeated  over  over again.

“Did you see a man   pit?” I said; but he made no answer  .
We became silent,  stood watching  a time side by side, deriving,
I fancy, a certain comfort  one another’s company. Then I shifted 
position  a little knoll  gave   advantage  a yard  more

too, on  side began  move towards  pit.

Then I saw some cabmen  others had walked boldly in  s-pits,
 heard  clatter  hoofs   gride  wheels. I saw a lad
trundling off  barrow  apples.  then, within thirty yards 
 pit, advancing   direction  Horsell, I noted a little
black knot  men,  foremost  whom was waving a white flag.

discreet distances.

Suddenly  was a flash  light,  a quantity  luminous
greenish smoke came out   pit  three distinct puffs, which drove
up, one after  other, straight in  still air.

 smoke ( flame, perhaps,  be  better word  ) was 
bright   deep blue sky overhead   hazy stretches  brown

abruptly  these puffs arose,   remain  darker after

Beyond  pit stood  little wedge  people   white flag

black shapes upon  black ground.   green smoke arose, 
faces flashed out pallid green,  faded again   vanished. Then
slowly  hissing passed in a humming, in a long, loud, droning
noise. Slowly a humped shape rose out   pit,   ghost  a
beam  light seemed  flicker out  .

Forth flashes  actual flame, a bright glare leaping  one 
another, sprang   scattered group  men.  was  if some
invisible jet impinged upon   flashed in white flame.  was
 if each man  suddenly  momentarily turned  fire.

Then, by  light   own destruction, I saw  staggering 
falling,   supporters turning  run.

I stood staring, not  yet realising   was death leaping 
man  man   little distant crowd. All I felt was   was
something very strange.  almost noiseless  blinding flash 
light,  a man fell headlong  lay still;    unseen shaft
 heat passed over , pine trees burst in fire,  every dry
furze bush became  one dull thud a mass  flames.  far away
towards Knaphill I saw  flashes  trees  hedges  wooden
buildings suddenly set alight.

invisible, inevitable sword  heat. I perceived  coming towards 
by  flashing bushes  touched,  was too astounded  stupefied
 stir. I heard  crackle  fire   s-pits   sudden
squeal  a horse  was  suddenly stilled. Then  was  if 
invisible yet intensely heated finger  drawn through  heather
between    Martians,  all along a curving line beyond

crash far away   left where  road  Woking station opens out
on  common. Forth-  hissing  humming ceased,  
black, dome-like object sank slowly out  sight in  pit.

All  had happened  such swiftness  I had stood motionless,
dumbfounded  dazzled by  flashes  light. Had  death swept
through a full circle,  must inevitably have slain    surprise.
But  passed  spared ,  left  night about  suddenly dark

 undulating common seemed now dark almost  blackness, except where
 roadways lay grey  pale under  deep blue sky   early
night.  was dark,  suddenly void  men. Overhead  stars 
mustering,    west  sky was still a pale, bright, almost
greenish blue.  tops   pine trees   roofs  Horsell came
out sharp  black against  western afterglow.  Martians 
 appliances  altogether invisible, save   thin mast
upon which  restless mirror wobbled. Patches  bush  isolated
trees here   smoked  glowed still,   houses towards
Woking station  sending up spires  flame in  stillness

Nothing was changed save    a terrible astonishment.

 came    I was upon  dark common, helpless, unprotected,
 alone. Suddenly, like a thing falling upon   without,
came—fear.

  effort I turned  began a stumbling run through  heather.

 fear I felt was no rational fear, but a panic terror not only 
 Martians, but   dusk  stillness all about . Such 
extraordinary effect  unmanning   had  I ran weeping silently
 a child might do. Once I had turned, I did not dare  look back.

I remember I felt  extraordinary persuasion  I was being played

mysterious death— swift   passage  light— leap after 
  pit about  cylinder,  strike  down.





 HEAT-RAY   CHOBHAM ROAD.


  still a matter  wonder how  Martians are able  slay men

Whatever  combustible flashes in flame   touch, lead runs like
water,  softens iron, cracks  melts glass,  when  falls upon
water, incontinently  explodes in steam.

 night nearly forty people lay under  starlight about  pit,
charred  distorted beyond recognition,  all night long  common
 Horsell  Maybury was deserted  brightly ablaze.

 news   massacre probably reached Chobham, Woking, 
Ottershaw about  same time.  Woking  shops had closed when 
tragedy happened,  a number  people, shop people   forth,
attracted by  stories  had heard,  walking over  Horsell
Bridge  along  road between  hedges  runs out  last upon
 common. You may imagine  young people brushed up after 
labours   day,  making  novelty,    make any
novelty,  excuse  walking together  enjoying a trivial
flirtation. You may figure  yourself  hum  voices along  road
  gloaming. . . .

 yet,  course, few people  Woking even knew   cylinder had
opened, though poor Henderson had sent a messenger on a bicycle  
post office  a special wire   evening paper.

 these folks came out by twos  threes upon  open,  found
little knots  people talking excitedly  peering   spinning

infected by  excitement   occasion.

By half past eight, when  Deputation was destroyed,  may have

window frames,  bringing down  crumbling ruin a portion

  sudden thud, hiss,  glare   igniting trees, 
panic-stricken crowd seems  have swayed hesitatingly  some
moments. Sparks  burning twigs began  fall in  road, 
single leaves like puffs  flame. Hats  dresses caught fire. Then
came a crying   common.   shrieks  shouts, 
suddenly a mounted policeman came galloping through  confusion 
his hands clasped over his head, screaming.

“’re coming!” a woman shrieked,  incontinently everyone was
turning  pushing  those behind,  order  clear  way

Where  road grows narrow  black between  high banks  crowd

HOW I REACHED HOME.


  own part, I remember nothing   flight except  stress 
blundering against trees  stumbling through  heather. All about
 gathered  invisible terrors   Martians;  pitiless sword

descended  smote  out  life. I came in  road between

I must have remained  some time.

I sat up, strangely perplexed.  a moment, perhaps, I  not
clearly underst how I came .  terror had fallen   like
a garment.  hat had gone,   collar had burst away  
fastener. A few minutes before,  had only been three real things
before — immensity   night  space  nature,  own
feebleness  anguish,   near approach  death. Now  was 
if something turned over,   point  view altered abruptly.

I rose  walked unsteadily up  steep incline   bridge. 
mind was blank wonder.  muscles  nerves seemed drained  
strength. I dare say I staggered drunkenly. A head rose over  arch,
  figure  a workman carrying a basket appeared. Beside him ran
a little boy. He passed , wishing  good night. I was minded 
speak  him, but did not. I answered his greeting  a meaningless
mumble  went on over  bridge.

Over  Maybury arch a train, a billowing tumult  white, firelit
smoke,  a long caterpillar  lighted windows, went flying
south—clatter, clatter, clap, rap,   had gone. A dim group 
people talked   gate  one   houses   pretty little row

very strong upon   night. Here was another side   dream.

But  trouble was  blank incongruity   serenity

stopped   group  people.

“What news   common?” said I.

  two men  a woman   gate.

“Eh?” said one   men, turning.

“What news   common?” I said.

“Ain’t yer just _been_ ?” asked  men.

“People seem fair silly about  common,” said  woman over 
gate. “What’s  all abart?”

“Haven’t you heard   men  Mars?” said I; “ creatures 
Mars?”

“Quite enough,” said  woman over  gate. “Thenks”;  all three
  laughed.

I felt foolish  angry. I tried  found I  not tell  what
I had seen.  laughed again   broken sentences.

“You’ll hear more yet,” I said,  went on   home.

I startled  wife   doorway,  haggard was I. I went in 
dining room, sat down, drank some wine,   soon  I  collect
myself sufficiently I told her  things I had seen.  dinner, which
was a cold one, had already been served,  remained neglected on 
table while I told  story.

“  one thing,” I said,  allay  fears I had aroused; “
are  most sluggish things I ever saw crawl.  may keep  pit

. But  horror  !”

“Don’t, dear!” said  wife, knitting her brows  putting her h on
mine.

“Poor Ogilvy!” I said. “ think he may be lying dead !”

 wife  least did not find  experience incredible. When I saw how
deadly white her face was, I ceased abruptly.

“ may come here,” she said again  again.

I pressed her  take wine,  tried  reassure her.

“ can scarcely move,” I said.

I began  comfort her  myself by repeating all  Ogilvy had told
   impossibility   Martians establishing themselves on 
earth.  particular I laid stress on  gravitational difficulty. On
 surface   earth  force  gravity  three times what  
on  surface  Mars. A Martian, therefore,  weigh three times
more than on Mars, albeit his muscular strength  be  same. His
own body  be a cope  lead  him, therefore. , indeed, was
 general opinion. Both _ Times_   _Daily Telegraph_, 
instance, insisted on   next morning,  both overlooked, just 
I did, two obvious modifying influences.

far less argon (whichever way one likes  put ) than does Mars’. 
invigorating influences   excess  oxygen upon  Martians
indisputably did much  counterbalance  increased weight  
bodies. ,   second place, we all overlooked  fact  such
mechanical intelligence   Martian possessed was quite able 
dispense  muscular exertion  a pinch.

But I did not consider these points   time,    reasoning
was dead against  chances   invaders.  wine  food,

grew by insensible degrees courageous  secure.

“A shell   pit,” said I, “if  worst comes   worst, will
kill  all.”

 intense excitement   events had no doubt left  perceptive
powers  a state  erethism. I remember  dinner table 
extraordinary vividness even now.  dear wife’s sweet anxious face
peering    under  pink lamp shade,  white cloth  
silver  glass table furniture—  those days even philosophical
writers had many little luxuries— crimson-purple wine   glass,
are photographically distinct.   end   I sat, tempering nuts
 a cigarette, regretting Ogilvy’s rashness,  denouncing 
short-sighted timidity   Martians.

So some respectable dodo   Mauritius might have lorded   his
nest,  discussed  arrival   shipful  pitiless sailors 
want  animal food. “We will peck   death tomorrow,  dear.”

I did not know , but  was  last civilised dinner I was  eat

FRIDAY NIGHT.


 most extraordinary thing   mind,  all  strange 
wonderful things  happened upon  Friday, was  dovetailing 
 commonplace habits  our social order   first beginnings 
 series  events  was  topple  social order headlong. If
on Friday night you had taken a pair  compasses  drawn a circle

 have had one human being outside , unless   some relation

talked about    leisure, but  certainly did not make

 London  night poor Henderson’s telegram describing  gradual
unscrewing   shot was judged  be a canard,  his evening
paper, after wiring  authentication  him  receiving no
reply— man was killed—decided not  print a special edition.

Even within  five-mile circle  great majority  people 
inert. I have already described  behaviour   men  women 
whom I spoke. All over  district people  dining  supping;
working men  gardening after  labours   day, children 
being put  bed, young people  wandering through  lanes
love-making, students sat over  books.

Maybe  was a murmur   village streets, a novel  dominant
topic   public-houses,  here   a messenger,  even 
eye-witness   later occurrences, caused a whirl  excitement, a
shouting,  a running   fro; but   most part  daily
routine  working, eating, drinking, sleeping, went on   had done
 countless years— though no planet Mars existed   sky. Even
 Woking station  Horsell  Chobham  was  case.

 Woking junction, until a late hour, trains  stopping  going
on, others  shunting on  sidings, passengers  alighting 
waiting,  everything was proceeding   most ordinary way. A boy
  town, trenching on Smith’s monopoly, was selling papers 
 afternoon’s news.  ringing impact  trucks,  sharp whistle
  engines   junction, mingled   shouts  “Men
 Mars!” Excited men came in  station about nine o’clock 
incredible tidings,  caused no more disturbance than drunkards might
have done. People rattling Londonwards peered in  darkness outside
 carriage windows,  saw only a rare, flickering, vanishing spark
dance up   direction  Horsell, a red glow  a thin veil 
smoke driving across  stars,  thought  nothing more serious
than a heath fire was happening.  was only round  edge  
common  any disturbance was perceptible.   half a dozen
villas burning on  Woking border.   lights  all 
houses on  common side   three villages,   people 
kept awake till dawn.

A curious crowd lingered restlessly, people coming  going but 
crowd remaining, both on  Chobham  Horsell bridges. One  two
adventurous souls,  was afterwards found, went in  darkness 
crawled quite near  Martians; but  never returned,  now 
again a light-ray, like  beam  a warship’s searchlight swept 
common,   Heat-Ray was ready  follow. Save  such,  big
area  common was silent  desolate,   charred bodies lay
about on  all night under  stars,  all  next day. A noise 
hammering   pit was heard by many people.

So you have  state  things on Friday night.   centre,
sticking in  skin  our old planet Earth like a poisoned dart,
was  cylinder. But  poison was scarcely working yet. Around 
was a patch  silent common, smouldering  places,   a few

Here   was a burning bush  tree. Beyond was a fringe

 FIGHTING BEGINS.


Saturday lives   memory  a day  suspense.  was a day 
lassitude too, hot  close, , I  told, a rapidly fluctuating
barometer. I had slept but little, though  wife had succeeded 
sleeping,  I rose early. I went in  garden before breakfast 
stood listening, but towards  common  was nothing stirring but
a lark.

 milkman came  usual. I heard  rattle  his chariot  I went
round   side gate  ask  latest news. He told   during
 night  Martians had been surrounded by troops,   guns
 expected. Then—a familiar, reassuring note—I heard a train running
towards Woking.

“ aren’t  be killed,” said  milkman, “if  can possibly be
avoided.”

I saw  neighbour gardening, chatted  him  a time,  then
strolled   breakfast.  was a most unexceptional morning. 
neighbour was  opinion   troops  be able  capture  
destroy  Martians during  day.

“’s a pity  make themselves  unapproachable,” he said. “
 be curious  know how  live on another planet; we might
learn a thing  two.”

He came up   fence  extended a handful  strawberries,  his
gardening was  generous   was enthusiastic.   same time he
told    burning   pine woods about  Byfleet Golf Links.

“ say,” said he, “ ’s another  those blessed things
fallen —number two. But one’s enough, surely.  lot’ll cost 
insurance people a pretty penny before everything’s settled.” He
laughed   air   greatest good humour  he said . 
woods, he said,  still burning,  pointed out a haze  smoke 
. “ will be hot under foot  days, on account   thick soil
 pine needles  turf,” he said,  then grew serious over “poor
Ogilvy.”

After breakfast, instead  working, I decided  walk down towards 
common. Under  railway bridge I found a group  soldiers—sappers, I
think, men  small round caps, dirty red jackets unbuttoned, 
showing  blue shirts, dark trousers,  boots coming   calf.
 told  no one was allowed over  canal, , looking along 
road towards  bridge, I saw one   Cardigan men standing
sentinel . I talked  these soldiers  a time; I told  
 sight   Martians on  previous evening. None   had seen
 Martians,   had but  vaguest ideas  ,   
plied   questions.  said   did not know who had
authorised  movements   troops;  idea was  a dispute
had arisen   Horse Guards.  ordinary sapper  a great deal
better educated than  common soldier,   discussed 
peculiar conditions   possible fight  some acuteness. I
described  Heat-Ray  ,   began  argue among
themselves.

“Crawl up under cover  rush ’em, say I,” said one.

“Get aht!” said another. “What’s cover against  ’ere ’eat? Sticks
 cook yer! What we got  do   go  near   ground’ll let
us,  then drive a trench.”

“Blow yer trenches! You always want trenches; you ought  ha’ been
born a rabbit Snippy.”

“Ain’t  got any necks, then?” said a third, abruptly—a little,
contemplative, dark man, smoking a pipe.

I repeated  description.

“Octopuses,” said he, “’s what I calls ’em. Talk about fishers 
men—fighters  fish    time!”

“ ain’t no murder killing beasts like ,” said  first speaker.

“Why not shell  darned things strite off  finish ’em?” said 
little dark man. “You carn tell what  might do.”

“Where’s your shells?” said  first speaker. “ ain’t no time. Do
  a rush, ’s  tip,  do   once.”

So  discussed . After a while I left ,  went on  
railway station  get  many morning papers  I .

But I will not weary  reader  a description   long morning
   longer afternoon. I did not succeed  getting a glimpse 
 common,  even Horsell  Chobham church towers   
hands   military authorities.  soldiers I addressed didn’t know
anything;  officers  mysterious  well  busy. I found people
  town quite secure again   presence   military,  I
heard   first time  Marshall,  tobacconist,  his son
was among  dead on  common.  soldiers had made  people on
 outskirts  Horsell lock up  leave  houses.

I got back  lunch about two, very tired ,  I have said,  day
was extremely hot  dull;   order  refresh myself I took a
cold bath   afternoon. About half past four I went up  
railway station  get  evening paper,   morning papers had
contained only a very inaccurate description   killing  Stent,
Henderson, Ogilvy,   others. But  was little I didn’t know.
 Martians did not show  inch  themselves.  seemed busy 
 pit,   was a sound  hammering   almost continuous
streamer  smoke. Apparently   busy getting ready  a
struggle. “Fresh attempts have been made  signal, but without
success,” was  stereotyped formula   papers. A sapper told 
 was done by a man  a ditch  a flag on a long pole. 
Martians took  much notice  such advances  we   
lowing  a cow.

I must confess  sight  all  armament, all  preparation,
greatly excited .  imagination became belligerent,  defeated 
invaders  a dozen striking ways; something   schoolboy dreams 
battle  heroism came back.  hardly seemed a fair fight   
 time.  seemed very helpless   pit  theirs.

About three o’clock  began  thud  a gun  measured intervals
 Chertsey  Addlestone. I learned   smouldering pine wood
in which  second cylinder had fallen was being shelled,  
hope  destroying  object before  opened.  was only about
five, however,  a field gun reached Chobham  use against 
first body  Martians.

About six   evening,  I sat  tea   wife  
summerhouse talking vigorously about  battle  was lowering upon
us, I heard a muffled detonation   common,  immediately after
a gust  firing. Close on  heels   came a violent rattling
crash, quite close  us,  shook  ground; , starting out upon
 lawn, I saw  tops   trees about  Oriental College burst
in smoky red flame,   tower   little church beside 
slide down in ruin.  pinnacle   mosque had vanished,  
roof line   college itself looked  if a hundred-ton gun had been
 work upon . One  our chimneys cracked  if a shot had hit ,
flew,  a piece   came clattering down  tiles  made a heap
 broken red fragments upon  flower bed by  study window.

I   wife stood amazed. Then I realised   crest  Maybury
Hill must be within range   Martians’ Heat-Ray now  
college was cleared out   way.

  I gripped  wife’s arm,  without ceremony ran her out in
 road. Then I fetched out  servant, telling her I  go
upstairs myself   box she was clamouring .

“We can’t possibly stay here,” I said;   I spoke  firing
reopened  a moment upon  common.

“But where are we  go?” said  wife  terror.

I thought perplexed. Then I remembered her cousins  Leatherhead.

“Leatherhead!” I shouted above  sudden noise.

She looked away   downhill.  people  coming out  
houses, astonished.

“How are we  get  Leatherhead?” she said.

Down  hill I saw a bevy  hussars ride under  railway bridge;
three galloped through  open gates   Oriental College; two
others dismounted,  began running  house  house.  sun,
shining through  smoke  drove up   tops   trees,
seemed blood red,  threw  unfamiliar lurid light upon everything.

“Stop here,” said I; “you are safe here”;  I started off  once 
 Spotted Dog,  I knew  landlord had a horse  dog cart. I
ran,  I perceived   a moment everyone upon  side  
hill  be moving. I found him  his bar, quite unaware  what was
going on behind his house. A man stood  his back  , talking 
him.

“I must have a pound,” said  landlord, “ I’ve no one  drive
.”

“I’ll give you two,” said I, over  stranger’s shoulder.

“What ?”

“ I’ll bring  back by midnight,” I said.

“Lord!” said  landlord; “what’s  hurry? I’m selling  bit  a
pig. Two pounds,  you bring  back? What’s going on now?”

I explained hastily  I had  leave  home,   secured  dog
cart.   time  did not seem   nearly  urgent  
landlord  leave his. I took care  have  cart   then,
drove  off down  road, , leaving   charge   wife 
servant, rushed in  house  packed a few valuables, such plate 
we had,   forth.  beech trees below  house  burning
while I did ,   palings up  road glowed red. While I was
occupied   way, one   dismounted hussars came running up. He
was going  house  house, warning people  leave. He was going on
 I came out   front door, lugging  treasures, done up  a
tablecloth. I shouted after him:

“What news?”

He turned, stared, bawled something about “crawling out  a thing like
a dish cover,”  ran on   gate   house   crest. A
sudden whirl  black smoke driving across  road hid him  a
moment. I ran   neighbour’s door  rapped  satisfy myself 
what I already knew,  his wife had gone  London  him  had
locked up  house. I went  again, according   promise,  get
 servant’s box, lugged  out, clapped  beside her on  tail 
 dog cart,  then caught  reins  jumped up in  driver’s
seat beside  wife.  another moment we  clear   smoke 
noise,  spanking down  opposite slope  Maybury Hill towards Old
Woking.

 front was a quiet sunny landscape, a wheat field ahead on either
side   road,   Maybury Inn   swinging sign. I saw 
doctor’s cart ahead  .   bottom   hill I turned  head
 look   hillside I was leaving. Thick streamers  black smoke
shot  threads  red fire  driving up in  still air, 
throwing dark shadows upon  green treetops eastward.  smoke
already extended far away   east  west—  Byfleet pine
woods eastward,   Woking on  west.  road was dotted 
people running towards us.  very faint now, but very distinct
through  hot, quiet air, one heard  whirr  a machine-gun 
was presently stilled,   intermittent cracking  rifles.
Apparently  Martians  setting fire  everything within range

I  not  expert driver,  I had immediately  turn  attention

black smoke. I slashed  horse   whip,  gave him a loose

  STORM.


Leatherhead  about twelve miles  Maybury Hill.  scent  hay
was   air through  lush meadows beyond Pyrford,   hedges
on either side  sweet  gay  multitudes  dog-roses. 
heavy firing  had broken out while we  driving down Maybury
Hill ceased  abruptly   began, leaving  evening very peaceful
 still. We got  Leatherhead without misadventure about nine
o’clock,   horse had  hour’s rest while I took supper  
cousins  commended  wife   care.

 wife was curiously silent throughout  drive,  seemed oppressed
 forebodings  evil. I talked  her reassuringly, pointing out
  Martians  tied   pit by sheer heaviness,   
utmost  but crawl a little out  ; but she answered only 
monosyllables. Had  not been   promise   innkeeper, she
, I think, have urged   stay  Leatherhead  night. 
 I had! Her face, I remember, was very white  we parted.

  own part, I had been feverishly excited all day. Something very
like  war fever  occasionally runs through a civilised community
had got in  blood,    heart I was not  very sorry  I
had  return  Maybury  night. I was even afraid   last
fusillade I had heard might mean  extermination  our invaders 
Mars. I can best express  state  mind by saying  I wanted  be
   death.

 was nearly eleven when I started  return.  night was
unexpectedly dark;  , walking out   lighted passage  
cousins’ house,  seemed indeed black,   was  hot  close 
 day. Overhead  clouds  driving fast, albeit not a breath
stirred  shrubs about us.  cousins’ man lit both lamps. Happily, I
knew  road intimately.  wife stood   light   doorway,
 watched  until I jumped up in  dog cart. Then abruptly she
turned  went , leaving  cousins side by side wishing  good
hap.

I was a little depressed  first   contagion   wife’s
fears, but very soon  thoughts reverted   Martians.   time
I was absolutely   dark    course   evening’s
fighting. I did not know even  circumstances  had precipitated
 conflict.  I came through Ockham (  was  way I
returned,  not through Send  Old Woking) I saw along  western
horizon a blood-red glow, which  I drew nearer, crept slowly up 
sky.  driving clouds   gathering thunderstorm mingled 
 masses  black  red smoke.

Ripley Street was deserted,  except  a lighted window   
village showed not a sign  life; but I narrowly escaped  accident
  corner   road  Pyrford, where a knot  people stood 
 backs  .  said nothing    I passed. I do not know
what  knew   things happening beyond  hill, nor do I know
if  silent houses I passed on  way  sleeping securely, 
deserted  empty,  harassed  watching against  terror  
night.

 Ripley until I came through Pyrford I was   valley  
Wey,   red glare was hidden  .  I ascended  little
hill beyond Pyrford Church  glare came in view again,  
trees about  shivered   first intimation   storm  was
upon . Then I heard midnight pealing out  Pyrford Church behind
,  then came  silhouette  Maybury Hill,   tree-tops
 roofs black  sharp against  red.

Even  I beheld  a lurid green glare lit  road about  
showed  distant woods towards Addlestone. I felt a tug   reins.
I saw   driving clouds had been pierced    by a thread
 green fire, suddenly lighting  confusion  falling in 
field   left.  was  third falling star!

Close on  apparition,  blindingly violet by contrast, danced out
 first lightning   gathering storm,   thunder burst like
a rocket overhead.  horse took  bit between his teeth  bolted.

A moderate incline runs towards  foot  Maybury Hill,  down 
we clattered. Once  lightning had begun,  went on   rapid a
succession  flashes  I have ever seen.  thunderclaps, treading
one on  heels  another   a strange crackling accompaniment,
sounded more like  working  a gigantic electric machine than 
usual detonating reverberations.  flickering light was blinding 
confusing,  a thin hail smote gustily   face  I drove down 
slope.

 first I regarded little but  road before ,  then abruptly 
attention was arrested by something  was moving rapidly down 
opposite slope  Maybury Hill.  first I took    wet roof 
a house, but one flash following another showed   be  swift
rolling movement.  was  elusive vision—a moment  bewildering
darkness,  then,  a flash like daylight,  red masses  
Orphanage near  crest   hill,  green tops   pine trees,
  problematical object came out clear  sharp  bright.

  Thing I saw! How can I describe ? A monstrous tripod, higher
than many houses, striding over  young pine trees,  smashing 
aside   career; a walking engine  glittering metal, striding now
across  heather; articulate ropes  steel dangling  ,  
clattering tumult   passage mingling   riot   thunder.
A flash,   came out vividly, heeling over one way  two feet 
 air,  vanish  reappear almost instantly   seemed,  
next flash, a hundred yards nearer. Can you imagine a milking stool
tilted  bowled violently along  ground?  was  impression
those instant flashes gave. But instead  a milking stool imagine  a
great body  machinery on a tripod st.

Then suddenly  trees   pine wood ahead    parted, 
brittle reeds are parted by a man thrusting through ;  
snapped off  driven headlong,  a second huge tripod appeared,
rushing,   seemed, headlong towards .  I was galloping hard 
meet !   sight   second monster  nerve went altogether.
Not stopping  look again, I wrenched  horse’s head hard round 
 right   another moment  dog cart had heeled over upon 
horse;  shafts smashed noisily,  I was flung sideways  fell
heavily in a shallow pool  water.

I crawled out almost immediately,  crouched,  feet still  
water, under a clump  furze.  horse lay motionless (his neck was
broken, poor brute!)  by  lightning flashes I saw  black bulk
  overturned dog cart   silhouette   wheel still
spinning slowly.  another moment  colossal mechanism went striding
by ,  passed uphill towards Pyrford.

Seen nearer,  Thing was incredibly strange,   was no mere
insensate machine driving on  way. Machine  was,  a ringing
metallic pace,  long, flexible, glittering tentacles (one  which
gripped a young pine tree) swinging  rattling about  strange
body.  picked  road   went striding along,   brazen hood
 surmounted  moved   fro   inevitable suggestion  a
head looking about. Behind  main body was a huge mass  white metal
like a gigantic fisherman’s basket,  puffs  green smoke squirted
out   joints   limbs   monster swept by .   
instant  was gone.

So much I saw then, all vaguely   flickering   lightning, 
blinding highlights  dense black shadows.

  passed  set up  exultant deafening howl  drowned 
thunder—“Aloo! Aloo!”—  another minute  was   companion,
half a mile away, stooping over something   field. I have no doubt
 Thing   field was  third   ten cylinders  had
fired  us  Mars.

 some minutes I lay    rain  darkness watching, by 
intermittent light, these monstrous beings  metal moving about  
distance over  hedge tops. A thin hail was now beginning,   
came  went  figures grew misty  then flashed in clearness
again. Now  then came a gap   lightning,   night
swallowed  up.

I was soaked  hail above  puddle water below.  was some time
before  blank astonishment  let  struggle up  bank  a
drier position,  think  all   imminent peril.

Not far   was a little one-roomed squatter’s hut  wood,
surrounded by a patch  pota garden. I struggled   feet  last,
, crouching  making use  every chance  cover, I made a run
 . I hammered   door, but I  not make  people hear
(if   any people inside),  after a time I desisted, ,
availing myself  a ditch   greater part   way, succeeded
 crawling, unobserved by these monstrous machines, in  pine
woods towards Maybury.

Under cover   I pushed on, wet  shivering now, towards  own
house. I walked among  trees trying  find  footpath.  was
very dark indeed   wood,   lightning was now becoming
infrequent,   hail, which was pouring down  a torrent, fell 
columns through  gaps   heavy foliage.

If I had fully realised  meaning  all  things I had seen I
 have immediately worked  way round through Byfleet  Street
Cobham,   gone back  rejoin  wife  Leatherhead. But 
night  strangeness  things about ,   physical wretchedness,
prevented ,  I was bruised, weary, wet   skin, deafened 
blinded by  storm.

I had a vague idea  going on   own house,   was  much
motive  I had. I staggered through  trees, fell in a ditch 
bruised  knees against a plank,  finally splashed out in 
lane  ran down   College Arms. I say splashed,   storm
water was sweeping  s down  hill  a muddy torrent.  
 darkness a man blundered in   sent  reeling back.

He gave a cry  terror, sprang sideways,  rushed on before I 
gather  wits sufficiently  speak  him. So heavy was  stress 
 storm just   place  I had  hardest task  win  way
up  hill. I went close up   fence on  left  worked  way
along  palings.

Near  top I stumbled upon something soft, , by a flash 
lightning, saw between  feet a heap  black broadcloth  a pair 
boots. Before I  distinguish clearly how  man lay,  flicker
 light had passed. I stood over him waiting   next flash. When
 came, I saw  he was a sturdy man, cheaply but not shabbily
dressed; his head was bent under his body,  he lay crumpled up close
  fence,  though he had been flung violently against .

Overcoming  repugnance natural  one who had never before touched a
dead body, I stooped  turned him over  feel  his heart. He was
quite dead. Apparently his neck had been broken.  lightning flashed
 a third time,  his face leaped upon . I sprang   feet. 
was  landlord   Spotted Dog, whose conveyance I had taken.

I stepped over him gingerly  pushed on up  hill. I made  way by
 police station   College Arms towards  own house. Nothing
was burning on  hillside, though   common  still came a
red glare  a rolling tumult  ruddy smoke beating up against 
drenching hail. So far  I  see by  flashes,  houses about
  mostly uninjured. By  College Arms a dark heap lay  
road.

Down  road towards Maybury Bridge   voices   sound 
feet, but I had not  courage  shout   go  . I let myself
   latchkey, closed, locked  bolted  door, staggered 
 foot   staircase,  sat down.  imagination was full 
those striding metallic monsters,    dead body smashed against
 fence.

I crouched   foot   staircase   back   wall,
shivering violently.




.
AT  WINDOW.


I have already said   storms  emotion have a trick 
exhausting themselves. After a time I discovered  I was cold 
wet,   little pools  water about  on  stair carpet. I got
up almost mechanically, went in  dining room  drank some
whisky,  then I was moved  change  clothes.

After I had done  I went upstairs   study, but why I did  I
do not know.  window   study looks over  trees  
railway towards Horsell Common.   hurry  our departure 
window had been left open.  passage was dark, , by contrast 
 picture  window frame enclosed,  side   room seemed
impenetrably dark. I stopped short   doorway.

 thunderstorm had passed.  towers   Oriental College  
pine trees about  had gone,  very far away, lit by a vivid red
glare,  common about  s-pits was visible. Across  light
huge black shapes, grotesque  strange, moved busily   fro.

 seemed indeed  if  whole country   direction was on
fire—a broad hillside set  minute tongues  flame, swaying 
writhing   gusts   dying storm,  throwing a red
reflection upon  cloud scud above. Every now  then a haze 
smoke  some nearer conflagration drove across  window  hid
 Martian shapes. I  not see what   doing, nor  clear
form  , nor recognise  black objects   busied upon.
Neither  I see  nearer fire, though  reflections  
danced on  wall  ceiling   study. A sharp, resinous tang 
burning was   air.

I closed  door noiselessly  crept towards  window.  I did
,  view opened out until, on  one h,  reached  
houses about Woking station,  on  other   charred 
blackened pine woods  Byfleet.  was a light down below  hill,
on  railway, near  arch,  several   houses along 
Maybury road   streets near  station  glowing ruins. 
light upon  railway puzzled   first;   a black heap 
a vivid glare,    right   a row  yellow oblongs. Then I
perceived  was a wrecked train,  fore part smashed  on fire,
 hinder carriages still upon  rails.

Between these three main centres  light— houses,  train, 
 burning county towards Chobham—stretched irregular patches  dark
country, broken here   by intervals  dimly glowing 
smoking ground.  was  strangest spectacle,  black expanse set
 fire.  reminded , more than anything else,   Potteries 
night.  first I  distinguish no people  all, though I peered
intently  . Later I saw against  light  Woking station a
number  black figures hurrying one after  other across  line.

  was  little world  which I had been living securely 
years,  fiery chaos! What had happened   last seven hours I
still did not know; nor did I know, though I was beginning  guess,
 relation between these mechanical colossi   sluggish lumps I
had seen disgorged   cylinder.  a queer feeling 
impersonal interest I turned  desk chair   window, sat down, 
stared   blackened country,  particularly   three gigantic
black things   going   fro   glare about 
s-pits.

 seemed amazingly busy. I began  ask myself what   be.
  intelligent mechanisms? Such a thing I felt was impossible.
 did a Martian sit within each, ruling, directing, using, much  a
man’s brain sits  rules  his body? I began  compare  things
 human machines,  ask myself   first time   life how 
ironclad  a steam engine  seem   intelligent lower animal.

 storm had left  sky clear,  over  smoke   burning
l  little fading pinpoint  Mars was dropping in  west,
when a soldier came in  garden. I heard a slight scraping  
fence,  rousing myself   lethargy  had fallen upon , I
looked down  saw him dimly, clambering over  palings.  
sight  another human being  torpor passed,  I leaned out  
window eagerly.

“Hist!” said I,  a whisper.

He stopped astride   fence  doubt. Then he came over  across
 lawn   corner   house. He bent down  stepped softly.

“Who’s ?” he said, al whispering, standing under  window 
peering up.

“Where are you going?” I asked.

“God knows.”

“Are you trying  hide?”

“’s .”

“Come in  house,” I said.

I went down, unfastened  door,  let him ,  locked  door
again. I  not see his face. He was hatless,  his coat was
unbuttoned.

“ God!” he said,  I drew him .

“What has happened?” I asked.

“What hasn’t?”   obscurity I  see he made a gesture 
despair. “ wiped us out—simply wiped us out,” he repeated again 
again.

He followed , almost mechanically, in  dining room.

“Take some whisky,” I said, pouring out a stiff dose.

He drank . Then abruptly he sat down before  table, put his head
on his arms,  began  sob  weep like a little boy,  a perfect
passion  emotion, while I,  a curious forgetfulness   own
recent despair, stood beside him, wondering.

 was a long time before he  steady his nerves  answer 
questions,  then he answered perplexingly  brokenly. He was a
driver   artillery,  had only come in action about seven. 
 time firing was going on across  common,   was said 
first party  Martians  crawling slowly towards  second
cylinder under cover  a metal shield.

Later  shield staggered up on tripod legs  became  first 
 fighting-machines I had seen.  gun he drove had been unlimbered
near Horsell,  order  comm  s-pits,   arrival  was
 had precipitated  action.   limber gunners went  
rear, his horse trod  a rabbit hole  came down, throwing him in
a depression   ground.   same moment  gun exploded behind
him,  ammunition blew up,  was fire all about him,  he found
himself lying under a heap  charred dead men  dead horses.

“I lay still,” he said, “scared out   wits,   fore quarter
 a horse atop  . We’d been wiped out.   smell—good God!
Like burnt meat! I was hurt across  back by  fall   horse,
  I had  lie until I felt better. Just like parade  had
been a minute before—then stumble, bang, swish!”

“Wiped out!” he said.

He had hid under  dead horse  a long time, peeping out furtively
across  common.  Cardigan men had tried a rush,  skirmishing
order,   pit, simply  be swept out  existence. Then 
monster had risen   feet  had begun  walk leisurely  
fro across  common among  few fugitives,   headlike hood
turning about exactly like  head  a cowled human being. A kind 
arm carried a complicated metallic case, about which green flashes
scintillated,  out   funnel    smoked  Heat-Ray.

 a few minutes  was,  far   soldier  see, not a
living thing left upon  common,  every bush  tree upon  
was not already a blackened skeleton was burning.  hussars had been
on  road beyond  curvature   ground,  he saw nothing 
. He heard  Maxims rattle  a time  then become still. 
giant saved Woking station   cluster  houses until  last;
then  a moment  Heat-Ray was brought  bear,   town became
a heap  fiery ruins. Then  Thing shut off  Heat-Ray, 
turning  back upon  artilleryman, began  waddle away towards
 smouldering pine woods  sheltered  second cylinder.  
did  a second glittering Titan built itself up out   pit.

 second monster followed  first,     artilleryman
began  crawl very cautiously across  hot heather ash towards
Horsell. He managed  get alive in  ditch by  side  
road,   escaped  Woking.  his story became ejaculatory. 
place was impassable.  seems   a few people alive ,
frantic   most part  many burned  scalded. He was turned
aside by  fire,  hid among some almost scorching heaps  broken
wall  one   Martian giants returned. He saw  one pursue a
man, catch him up  one   steely tentacles,  knock his head
against  trunk  a pine tree.  last, after nightfall, 
artilleryman made a rush    got over  railway embankment.

Since then he had been skulking along towards Maybury,   hope 
getting out  danger Londonward. People  hiding  trenches 
cellars,  many   survivors had made off towards Woking village
 Send. He had been consumed  thirst until he found one  
water mains near  railway arch smashed,   water bubbling out
like a spring upon  road.

 was  story I got  him, bit by bit. He grew calmer telling
  trying  make  see  things he had seen. He had eaten no
food since midday, he told  early  his narrative,  I found some
mutton  bread   pantry  brought  in  room. We lit no
lamp  fear  attracting  Martians,  ever  again our hands
 touch upon bread  meat.  he talked, things about us came
darkly out   darkness,   trampled bushes  broken rose
trees outside  window grew distinct.   seem  a number 
men  animals had rushed across  lawn. I began  see his face,
blackened  haggard,  no doubt mine was al.

When we had finished eating we went softly upstairs   study,  I
looked again out   open window.  one night  valley had become
a valley  ashes.  fires had dwindled now. Where flames had been
  now streamers  smoke; but  countless ruins  shattered
 gutted houses  blasted  blackened trees   night had
hidden stood out now gaunt  terrible   pitiless light  dawn.
Yet here   some object had had  luck  escape—a white
railway signal here,  end  a greenhouse , white  fresh
amid  wreckage. Never before   history  warfare had
destruction been  indiscriminate   universal.  shining 
 growing light   east, three   metallic giants stood about
 pit,  cowls rotating  though   surveying 
desolation  had made.

 seemed     pit had been enlarged,  ever  again
puffs  vivid green vapour streamed up  out   towards 
brightening dawn—streamed up, whirled, broke,  vanished.

Beyond   pillars  fire about Chobham.  became pillars 
bloodshot smoke   first touch  day.




I.
WHAT I SAW OF  DESTRUCTION OF WEYBRIDGE AND SHEPPERTON.


  dawn grew brighter we withdrew   window  which we had
watched  Martians,  went very quietly downstairs.

 artilleryman agreed     house was no place  stay .
He proposed, he said,  make his way Londonward,  thence rejoin his
battery—No. 12,   Horse Artillery.  plan was  return  once
 Leatherhead;   greatly had  strength   Martians
impressed   I had determined  take  wife  Newhaven,  go
 her out   country forth.  I already perceived clearly
  country about London must inevitably be  scene  a
disastrous struggle before such creatures  these  be destroyed.

Between us  Leatherhead, however, lay  third cylinder,  
guarding giants. Had I been alone, I think I  have taken 
chance  struck across country. But  artilleryman dissuaded :
“’s no kindness   right sort  wife,” he said, “ make her a
widow”;    end I agreed  go  him, under cover  
woods, northward  far  Street Cobham before I parted  him.
Thence I  make a big detour by Epsom  reach Leatherhead.

I  have started  once, but  companion had been  active
service  he knew better than . He made  ransack  house 
a flask, which he filled  whisky;  we lined every available
pocket  packets  biscuits  slices  meat. Then we crept out
  house,  ran  quickly  we  down  ill-made road by
which I had come overnight.  houses seemed deserted.   road lay
a group  three charred bodies close together, struck dead by 
Heat-Ray;  here    things  people had dropped—a
clock, a slipper, a silver spoon,   like poor valuables.  
corner turning up towards  post office a little cart, filled 
boxes  furniture,  horseless, heeled over on a broken wheel. A
cash box had been hastily smashed open  thrown under  debris.

Except  lodge   Orphanage, which was still on fire, none  
houses had suffered very greatly here.  Heat-Ray had shaved 
chimney tops  passed. Yet, save ourselves,  did not seem  be
a living soul on Maybury Hill.  majority   inhabitants had
escaped, I suppose, by way   Old Woking road— road I had taken
when I drove  Leatherhead—  had hidden.

We went down  lane, by  body   man  black, sodden now 
 overnight hail,  broke in  woods   foot   hill.
We pushed through these towards  railway without meeting a soul. 
woods across  line  but  scarred  blackened ruins 
woods;   most part  trees had fallen, but a certain proportion
still stood, dismal grey stems,  dark brown foliage instead 
green.

On our side  fire had done no more than scorch  nearer trees; 
had failed  secure  footing.  one place  woodmen had been 
work on Saturday; trees, felled  freshly trimmed, lay  a clearing,
 heaps  sawdust by  sawing-machine   engine. Hard by was
a temporary hut, deserted.  was not a breath  wind  morning,
 everything was strangely still. Even  birds  hushed,  
we hurried along I   artilleryman talked  whispers  looked
now  again over our shoulders. Once  twice we stopped  listen.

After a time we drew near  road,   we did  we heard 
clatter  hoofs  saw through  tree stems three cavalry soldiers
riding slowly towards Woking. We hailed ,   halted while we
hurried towards .  was a lieutenant  a couple  privates 
 8th Hussars,  a st like a theodolite, which  artilleryman
told  was a heliograph.

“You are  first men I’ve seen coming  way  morning,” said
 lieutenant. “What’s brewing?”

His voice  face  eager.  men behind him stared curiously. 
artilleryman jumped down  bank in  road  saluted.

“Gun destroyed last night, sir. Have been hiding. Trying  rejoin
battery, sir. You’ll come  sight   Martians, I expect, about
half a mile along  road.”

“What  dickens are  like?” asked  lieutenant.

“Giants  armour, sir. Hundred feet high. Three legs  a body like
’luminium,  a mighty great head  a hood, sir.”

“Get out!” said  lieutenant. “What confounded nonsense!”

“You’ll see, sir.  carry a kind  box, sir,  shoots fire 
strikes you dead.”

“What d’ye mean—a gun?”

“No, sir,”   artilleryman began a vivid account   Heat-Ray.
Halfway through,  lieutenant interrupted him  looked up  . I
was still standing on  bank by  side   road.

“’s perfectly true,” I said.

“Well,” said  lieutenant, “I suppose ’s  business  see  too.
Look here”—  artilleryman—“we’re detailed here clearing people out
  houses. You’d better go along  report yourself 
Brigadier-General Marvin,  tell him all you know. He’s  Weybridge.
Know  way?”

“I do,” I said;  he turned his horse southward again.

“Half a mile, you say?” said he.

“ most,” I answered,  pointed over  treetops southward. He
thanked   rode on,  we saw  no more.

Farther along we came upon a group  three women  two children 
 road, busy clearing out a labourer’s cottage.  had got hold 
a little h truck,   piling  up  unclean-looking bundles
 shabby furniture.   all too assiduously engaged  talk

Byfleet was  a tumult; people packing,  a score  hussars, some
  dismounted, some on horseback,  hunting  about. Three

Across  Thames, except just where  boats landed, everything was

“What’s ?” cried a boatman,  “Shut up, you fool!” said a man
near   a yelping dog. Then  sound came again,  time  
direction  Chertsey, a muffled thud— sound  a gun.

 fighting was beginning. Almost immediately unseen batteries across
 river  our right, unseen because   trees, took up 
chorus, firing heavily one after  other. A woman screamed. Everyone
stood arrested by  sudden stir  battle, near us  yet invisible

unconcernedly   most part,  silvery pollard willows motionless

“ sojers’ll stop ’em,” said a woman beside , doubtfully. A
haziness rose over  treetops.

Then suddenly we saw a rush  smoke far away up  river, a puff 
smoke  jerked up in  air  hung;  forth  ground
heaved under foot  a heavy explosion shook  air, smashing two

“Here  are!” shouted a man  a blue jersey. “Yonder! D’yer see

Quickly, one after  other, one, two, three, four   armoured
Martians appeared, far away over  little trees, across  flat
meadows  stretched towards Chertsey,  striding hurriedly towards

“You have been asking  water   last hour,” he said.

found  a strange enough figure, naked, save   water-soaked
trousers  socks, scalded,   face  shoulders blackened by 
smoke. His face was a fair weakness, his chin retreated,  his hair
lay  crisp, almost flaxen curls on his low forehead; his eyes 
rather large, pale blue,  blankly staring. He spoke abruptly,
looking vacantly away  .

“What does  mean?” he said. “What do these things mean?”

He extended a thin white h  spoke  almost a complaining tone.

“Neither  one nor, perhaps,  other,” I answered. “

overhead  dawn was growing brighter, clear  steady  calm.

He heard footsteps running   fro   rooms,  up  down

WHAT HAD HAPPENED  SURREY.


 was while  curate had sat  talked  wildly   under 
hedge   flat meadows near Halliford,  while  brother was
watching  fugitives stream over Westminster Bridge,  
Martians had resumed  offensive. So far  one can ascertain 
 conflicting accounts  have been put forth,  majority  
remained busied  preparations   Horsell pit until nine 
night, hurrying on some operation  disengaged huge volumes  green
smoke.

But three certainly came out about eight o’clock , advancing slowly
 cautiously, made  way through Byfleet  Pyrford towards
Ripley  Weybridge,   came  sight   expectant batteries
against  setting sun. These Martians did not advance  a body, but
 a line, each perhaps a mile  a half  his nearest fellow. 
communicated  one another by means  sirenlike howls, running up
 down  scale  one note  another.

 was  howling  firing   guns  Ripley  St. George’s
Hill  we had heard  Upper Halliford.  Ripley gunners,
unseasoned artillery volunteers who ought never  have been placed 
such a position, fired one wild, premature, ineffectual volley, 
bolted on horse  foot through  deserted village, while 
Martian, without using his Heat-Ray, walked serenely over  guns,
stepped gingerly among , passed  front  ,   came
unexpectedly upon  guns  Painshill Park, which he destroyed.

 St. George’s Hill men, however,  better led   a better
mettle. Hidden by a pine wood   ,  seem  have been

 shells flashed all round him,  he was seen  advance a few
paces, stagger,  go down. Everybody yelled together,   guns
 reloaded  frantic haste.  overthrown Martian set up a
prolonged ululation,  immediately a second glittering giant,
answering him, appeared over  trees   south.   seem 
a leg   tripod had been smashed by one   shells.  whole 
 second volley flew wide   Martian on  ground, ,
simultaneously, both his companions brought  Heat-Rays  bear on
 battery.  ammunition blew up,  pine trees all about  guns
flashed in fire,  only one  two   men who  already
running over  crest   hill escaped.

After    seem   three took counsel together 
halted,   scouts who  watching  report   remained
absolutely stationary   next half hour.  Martian who had been
overthrown crawled tediously out  his hood, a small brown figure,
oddly suggestive   distance  a speck  blight, 
apparently engaged   repair  his support. About nine he had
finished,  his cowl was then seen above  trees again.

 was a few minutes past nine  night when these three sentinels
 joined by four other Martians, each carrying a thick black tube. A
similar tube was handed  each   three,   seven proceeded
 distribute themselves  equal distances along a curved line between
St. George’s Hill, Weybridge,   village  Send, southwest 
Ripley.

A dozen rockets sprang out   hills before   soon  
began  move,  warned  waiting batteries about Ditton  Esher.
  same time four   fighting machines, similarly armed 
tubes, crossed  river,  two  , black against  western
sky, came in sight  myself   curate  we hurried wearily 
painfully along  road  runs northward out  Halliford.

running; but I knew  was no good running  a Martian,  I turned
aside  crawled through dewy nettles  brambles in  broad
ditch by  side   road. He looked back, saw what I was doing,
 turned  join .

 two halted,  nearer  us standing  facing Sunbury, 
remoter being a grey indistinctness towards  evening star, away
towards Staines.

 occasional howling   Martians had ceased;  took up 
positions   huge crescent about  cylinders  absolute

 us    observer about Ripley   have had precisely 
same effect— Martians seemed  solitary possession   darkling
night, lit only   was by  slender moon,  stars,  afterglow
  daylight,   ruddy glare  St. George’s Hill

But facing  crescent everywhere— Staines, Hounslow, Ditton,
Esher, Ockham, behind hills  woods south   river,  across
 flat grass meadows   north  , wherever a cluster  trees
 village houses gave sufficient cover— guns  waiting. 
signal rockets burst  rained  sparks through  night 
vanished,   spirit  all those watching batteries rose  a
tense expectation.  Martians had but  advance in  line 
fire,  instantly those motionless black forms  men, those guns
glittering  darkly   early night,  explode in a
thunderous fury  battle.

No doubt  thought  was uppermost  a thous  those vigilant
minds, even   was uppermost  mine, was  riddle—how much 
understood  us. Did  grasp  we  our millions 
organized, disciplined, working together?  did  interpret our
spurts  fire,  sudden stinging  our shells, our steady
investment   encampment,  we   furious unanimity 
onslaught  a disturbed hive  bees? Did  dream  might
exterminate us? (  time no one knew what food  needed.) A
hundred such questions struggled together   mind  I watched

pitfalls?   powder mills  Hounslow ready  a snare?  
Londoners have  heart  courage  make a greater Moscow

Then, after  interminable time,   seemed  us, crouching 
peering through  hedge, came a sound like  distant concussion 
a gun. Another nearer,  then another.  then  Martian beside us
raised his tube on high  discharged , gunwise,  a heavy report
 made  ground heave.  one towards Staines answered him.

I was  excited by these heavy minute-guns following one another

report followed,  a big projectile hurtled overhead towards
Hounslow. I expected  least  see smoke  fire,  some such

one solitary star,   white mist spreading wide  low beneath.
  had been no crash, no answering explosion.  silence was
restored;  minute lengthened  three.

“What has happened?” said  curate, standing up beside .

“Heaven knows!” said I.

A bat flickered by  vanished. A distant tumult  shouting began 
ceased. I looked again   Martian,  saw he was now moving
eastward along  riverbank,  a swift, rolling motion.

Every moment I expected  fire  some hidden battery  spring upon
him; but  evening calm was unbroken.  figure   Martian grew
smaller  he receded,  presently  mist   gathering night
had swallowed him up. By a common impulse we clambered higher. Towards
Sunbury was a dark appearance,  though a conical hill had suddenly
come in being , hiding our view   farther country; 
then, remoter across  river, over Walton, we saw another such
summit. These hill-like forms grew lower  broader even  we stared.

Moved by a sudden thought, I looked northward,   I perceived a
third  these cloudy black kopjes had risen.

Everything had suddenly become very still. Far away   southeast,
marking  quiet, we heard  Martians hooting  one another, 
then  air quivered again   distant thud   guns. But
 earthly artillery made no reply.

Now   time we  not underst these things, but later I was
 learn  meaning  these ominous kopjes  gathered  
twilight. Each   Martians, standing   great crescent I have
described, had discharged, by means   gunlike tube he carried, a
huge canister over whatever hill, copse, cluster  houses,  other
possible cover  guns, chanced  be  front  him. Some fired only
one  these, some two—   case   one we had seen;  one
 Ripley  said  have discharged no fewer than five   time.

So, setting about   methodically  men might smoke out a wasps’

Londonward country.  horns   crescent slowly moved apart, until

So, quite unexpectedly,  brother found himself, panting,  a cut

“We have money,” said  slender woman,  hesitated.

Her eyes met  brother’s,  her hesitation ended.

“So have I,” said  brother.

She explained   had  much  thirty pounds  gold, besides a

hopeless, seeing  fury   Londoners  crowd upon  trains,

Mister. Elphinstone— was  name   woman  white— listen

was astonishingly quiet  deliberate,   last agreed

 his hair   other beating invisible things. His paroxysm 
rage over, he went on his way without once looking back.

  brother’s party went on towards  crossroads   south 
Barnet  saw a woman approaching  road across some fields on
 left, carrying a child   two other children;  then
passed a man  dirty black,  a thick stick  one h  a small
portmanteau   other. Then round  corner   lane, 
between  villas  guarded    confluence   high
road, came a little cart drawn by a sweating black pony  driven by a
sallow youth  a bowler hat, grey  dust.   three girls,
East End factory girls,  a couple  little children crowded  
cart.

“’ll tike us rahnd Edgware?” asked  driver, wild-eyed,
white-faced;  when  brother told him   if he turned  
left, he whipped up  once without  formality  thanks.

 brother noticed a pale grey smoke  haze rising among  houses 
front  ,  veiling  white façade  a terrace beyond 
road  appeared between  backs   villas. Mister. Elphinstone
suddenly cried out  a number  tongues  smoky red flame leaping up
above  houses  front   against  hot, blue sky. 
tumultuous noise resolved itself now in  disorderly mingling 
many voices,  gride  many wheels,  creaking  waggons,  
stacca  hoofs.  lane came round sharply not fifty yards  
crossroads.

“Good heavens!” cried Mister. Elphinstone. “What   you are driving
us in?”

 brother stopped.

  main road was a boiling stream  people, a torrent  human
beings rushing northward, one pressing on another. A great bank 
dust, white  luminous   blaze   sun, made everything
within twenty feet   ground grey  indistinct  was
perpetually renewed by  hurrying feet  a dense crowd  horses 
 men  women on foot,  by  wheels  vehicles  every
description.

“Way!”  brother heard voices crying. “Make way!”

 was like riding in  smoke  a fire  approach  meeting
point   lane  road;  crowd roared like a fire,   dust
was hot  pungent. , indeed, a little way up  road a villa was
burning  sending rolling masses  black smoke across  road 
add   confusion.

Two men came past . Then a dirty woman, carrying a heavy bundle 
weeping. A lost retriever dog,  hanging tongue, circled dubiously
round , scared  wretched,  fled   brother’s threat.

So much    see   road Londonward between  houses 
 right was a tumultuous stream  dirty, hurrying people, pent 
between  villas on either side;  black heads,  crowded forms,
grew in distinctness   rushed towards  corner, hurried past,
 merged  individuality again  a receding multitude  was
swallowed up  last  a cloud  dust.

“Go on! Go on!” cried  voices. “Way! Way!”

One man’s hands pressed on  back  another.  brother stood  
pony’s head. Irresistibly attracted, he advanced slowly, pace by pace,
down  lane.

Edgware had been a scene  confusion, Chalk Farm a riotous tumult, but
 was a whole population  movement.   hard  imagine 
host.  had no character   own.  figures poured out past 
corner,  receded   backs   group   lane. Along
 margin came those who  on foot threatened by  wheels,
stumbling   ditches, blundering in one another.

 carts  carriages crowded close upon one another, making little
way  those swifter  more impatient vehicles  darted forward
every now  then when  opportunity showed itself  doing ,
sending  people scattering against  fences  gates  
villas.

“Push on!” was  cry. “Push on!  are coming!”

 one cart stood a blind man   uniform   Salvation Army,
gesticulating  his crooked fingers  bawling, “Eternity!
Eternity!” His voice was hoarse  very loud    brother 
hear him long after he was lost  sight   dust. Some  
people who crowded   carts whipped stupidly   horses 
quarrelled  other drivers; some sat motionless, staring  nothing
 miserable eyes; some gnawed  hands  thirst,  lay
prostrate   bottoms   conveyances.  horses’ bits 
covered  foam,  eyes bloodshot.

  cabs, carriages, shop-carts, waggons, beyond counting; a
mail cart, a road-cleaner’s cart marked “stry  St. Pancras,” a huge
timber waggon crowded  roughs. A brewer’s dray rumbled by  
two near wheels splashed  fresh blood.

“Clear  way!” cried  voices. “Clear  way!”

“Eter-nity! Eter-nity!” came echoing down  road.

  sad, haggard women tramping by, well dressed,  children
 cried  stumbled,  dainty clothes smothered  dust, 
weary faces smeared  tears.  many  these came men, sometimes
helpful, sometimes lowering  savage. Fighting side by side  
pushed some weary street outcast  faded black rags, wide-eyed,
loud-voiced,  foul-mouthed.   sturdy workmen thrusting
 way along, wretched, unkempt men, clothed like clerks  shopmen,
struggling spasmodically; a wounded soldier  brother noticed, men
dressed   clothes  railway porters, one wretched creature  a
nightshirt  a coat thrown over .

But varied   composition was, certain things all  host had 
common.   fear  pain on  faces,  fear behind .
A tumult up  road, a quarrel  a place  a waggon, sent  whole
host   quickening  pace; even a man  scared  broken
 his knees bent under him was galvanised  a moment in renewed
activity.  heat  dust had already been  work upon 
multitude.  skins  dry,  lips black  cracked. 
 all thirsty, weary,  footsore.  amid  various cries one
heard disputes, reproaches, groans  weariness  fatigue;  voices
 most    hoarse  weak. Through  all ran a refrain:

“Way! Way!  Martians are coming!”

Few stopped  came aside   flood.  lane opened slantingly
in  main road  a narrow opening,  had a delusive appearance
 coming   direction  London. Yet a kind  eddy  people
drove in  mouth; weaklings elbowed out   stream, who  
most part rested but a moment before plunging in  again. A little
way down  lane,  two friends bending over him, lay a man  a
bare leg, wrapped about  bloody rags. He was a lucky man  have
friends.

A little old man,  a grey military moustache  a filthy black
frock coat, limped out  sat down beside  trap, removed his
boot—his sock was blood-stained—shook out a pebble,  hobbled on
again;  then a little girl  eight  nine, all alone, threw
herself under  hedge close by  brother, weeping.

“I can’t go on! I can’t go on!”

 brother woke  his torpor  astonishment  lifted her up,
speaking gently  her,  carried her  Miss Elphinstone. So soon 
 brother touched her she became quite still,  if frightened.

“Ellen!” shrieked a woman   crowd,  tears  her

crying “Mother!”

“ are coming,” said a man on horseback, riding past along  lane.

“Out   way, !” bawled a coachman, towering high;  
brother saw a closed carriage turning in  lane.

So soon   cab had passed, he flung himself,  both hands open,

horse rose close upon him,   another moment, half rising, he had

Then beyond  bend  brother stopped again. Miss Elphinstone was

 “THUNDER CHILD”.


Had  Martians aimed only  destruction,  might on Monday have
annihilated  entire population  London,   spread itself slowly
through  home counties. Not only along  road through Barnet, but
al through Edgware  Waltham Abbey,  along  roads eastward 
Southend  Shoeburyness,  south   Thames  Deal 
Broadstairs, poured  same frantic rout. If one  have hung 
June morning  a balloon   blazing blue above London every
northward  eastward road running out   tangled maze  streets
 have seemed stippled black   streaming fugitives, each dot
a human agony  terror  physical distress. I have set forth 
length   last chapter  brother’s account   road through
Chipping Barnet,  order   readers may realise how  swarming
 black dots appeared  one  those concerned. Never before  
history   world had such a mass  human beings moved  suffered
together.  legendary hosts  Goths  Huns,  hugest armies Asia
has ever seen,  have been but a drop   current.   was
no disciplined march;  was a stampede—a stampede gigantic 
terrible—without order  without a goal, six million people unarmed
 unprovisioned, driving headlong.  was  beginning   rout
 civilisation,   massacre  mankind.

Directly below him  balloonist  have seen  network 
streets far  wide, houses, churches, squares, crescents,
gardens—already derelict—spread out like a huge map,   
southward _blotted_. Over Ealing, Richmond, Wimbledon,   have
seemed  if some monstrous pen had flung ink upon  chart. Steadily,
incessantly, each black splash grew  spread, shooting out
ramifications  way  , now banking itself against rising
ground, now pouring swiftly over a crest in a new-found valley,
exactly  a gout  ink  spread itself upon blotting paper.

 beyond, over  blue hills  rise southward   river, 
glittering Martians went   fro, calmly  methodically spreading

Until about midday  Pool  London was  astonishing scene.
Steamboats  shipping  all sorts lay , tempted by  enormous
sums  money offered by fugitives,    said  many who swam
out  these vessels  thrust off  boathooks  drowned. About
one o’clock   afternoon  thinning remnant  a cloud  
black vapour appeared between  arches  Blackfriars Bridge.  
 Pool became a scene  mad confusion, fighting,  collision,

On Wednesday  three fugitives— had passed  night  a field

brother, very luckily  him   chanced, preferred  push on 
once   coast rather than wait  food, although all three  
 very hungry. By midday  passed through Tillingham, which,
strangely enough, seemed  be quite silent  deserted, save  a
few furtive plunderers hunting  food. Near Tillingham  suddenly
came  sight   sea,   most amazing crowd  shipping  all
sorts    possible  imagine.

Close inshore was a multitude  fishing smacks—English, Scotch,

filthy colliers, trim merchantmen, cattle ships, passenger boats,
petroleum tanks, ocean tramps,  old white transport even, neat white
 grey liners  Southampton  Hamburg;  along  blue coast
across  Blackwater  brother  make out dimly a dense swarm 
boats chaffering   people on  beach, a swarm which al
extended up  Blackwater almost  Maldon.

About a couple  miles out lay  ironclad, very low   water,

  sight   sea, Mister. Elphinstone,  spite   assurances
 her sister--law, gave way  panic. She had never been out 
Engl before, she  rather die than trust herself friendless  a
foreign country,   forth. She seemed, poor woman,  imagine 
 French   Martians might prove very similar. She had been
growing increasingly hysterical, fearful,  depressed during  two
days’ journeyings. Her great idea was  return  Stanmore. Things had
been always well  safe  Stanmore.   find George

Glancing northwestward,  brother saw  large crescent  shipping

launches rushing hither  thither. He was  fascinated by

Leatherhead, terrified,  danger, mourning  already  a dead man. I
paced  rooms  cried aloud when I thought  how I was cut off
 her,  all  might happen  her   absence.  cousin I
knew was brave enough  any emergency, but he was not  sort  man
 realise danger quickly,  rise promptly. What was needed now was
not bravery, but circumspection.  only consolation was  believe
  Martians  moving Londonward  away  her. Such vague
anxieties keep  mind sensitive  painful. I grew very weary 
irritable   curate’s perpetual ejaculations; I tired  
sight  his selfish despair. After some ineffectual remonstrance I
kept away  him, staying  a room—evidently a children’s
schoolroom—containing globes, forms,  copybooks. When he followed 
thither, I went  a box room   top   house ,  order 
be alone   aching miseries, locked myself .

We  hopelessly hemmed  by  Black Smoke all  day  
morning   next.   signs  people   next house on
Sunday evening—a face  a window  moving lights,  later 
slamming  a door. But I do not know who these people , nor what
became  . We saw nothing   next day.  Black Smoke
drifted slowly riverward all through Monday morning, creeping nearer
 nearer  us, driving  last along  roadway outside  house
 hid us.

A Martian came across  fields about midday, laying  stuff  a
jet  superheated steam  hissed against  walls, smashed all 
windows  touched,  scalded  curate’s h  he fled out  
front room. When  last we crept across  sodden rooms  looked
out again,  country northward was  though a black snowstorm had
passed over . Looking towards  river, we  astonished  see 
unaccountable redness mingling   black   scorched meadows.

 a time we did not see how  change affected our position, save
 we  relieved  our fear   Black Smoke. But later I
perceived  we  no longer hemmed ,  now we might get away.
So soon  I realised   way  escape was open,  dream 
action returned. But  curate was lethargic, unreasonable.

“We are safe here,” he repeated; “safe here.”

I resolved  leave him—  I had! Wiser now  
artilleryman’s teaching, I sought out food  drink. I had found oil
 rags   burns,  I al took a hat  a flannel shirt  I
found  one   bedrooms. When  was clear  him  I meant 
go alone—had reconciled myself  going alone—he suddenly roused
himself  come.  all being quiet throughout  afternoon, we
started about five o’clock,  I  judge, along  blackened road
 Sunbury.

contorted attitudes, horses  well  men, overturned carts 
luggage, all covered thickly  black dust.  pall  cindery

We got  Hampton Court without misadventure, our minds full  strange

went through Bushey Park,   deer going   fro under 
chestnuts,  some men  women hurrying   distance towards

saw.

 most part   like ourselves, taking advantage  a lull 
shift  quarters. I have  impression  many   houses here
 still occupied by scared inhabitants, too frightened even 
flight. Here too  evidence  a hasty rout was abundant along 
road. I remember most vividly three smashed bicycles  a heap, pounded
in  road by  wheels  subsequent carts. We crossed Richmond
Bridge about half past eight. We hurried across  exposed bridge, 
course, but I noticed floating down  stream a number  red masses,
some many feet across. I did not know what these — was no time
 scrutiny— I put a more horrible interpretation on  than 
deserved. Here again on  Surrey side  black dust  had once
been smoke,  dead bodies—a heap near  approach   station;
but we had no glimpse   Martians until we  some way towards
Barnes.

We saw   blackened distance a group  three people running down a
side street towards  river, but otherwise  seemed deserted. Up 
hill Richmond town was burning briskly; outside  town  Richmond
 was no trace   Black Smoke.

Then suddenly,  we approached Kew, came a number  people running,
  upperworks  a Martian fighting-machine loomed  sight over
 housetops, not a hundred yards away  us. We stood aghast  our
danger,  had  Martian looked down we must immediately have
perished. We   terrified  we dared not go on, but turned
aside  hid  a shed  a garden.   curate crouched, weeping
silently,  refusing  stir again.

But  fixed idea  reaching Leatherhead  not let  rest,  
 twilight I ventured out again. I went through a shrubbery, 
along a passage beside a big house standing   own grounds,  
emerged upon  road towards Kew.  curate I left   shed, but
he came hurrying after .

 second start was  most foolhardy thing I ever did.   was
manifest  Martians  about us. No sooner had  curate overtaken
 than we saw either  fighting-machine we had seen before 
another, far away across  meadows   direction  Kew Lodge.
Four  five little black figures hurried before  across 
green-grey   field,   a moment  was evident  Martian
pursued .  three strides he was among ,   ran
radiating  his feet  all directions. He used no Heat-Ray 
destroy , but picked  up one by one. Apparently he tossed 
in  great metallic carrier which projected behind him, much  a
workman’s basket hangs over his shoulder.

 was  first time I realised   Martians might have any other
purpose than destruction  defeated humanity. We stood  a moment
petrified, then turned  fled through a gate behind us in a walled
garden, fell in, rather than found, a fortunate ditch,  lay ,
scarce daring  whisper  each other until  stars  out.

I suppose  was nearly eleven o’clock before we gathered courage 
start again, no longer venturing in  road, but sneaking along
hedgerows  through plantations,  watching keenly through 
darkness, he on  right  I on  left,   Martians, who
seemed  be all about us.  one place we blundered upon a scorched
 blackened area, now cooling  ashen,  a number  scattered
dead bodies  men, burned horribly about  heads  trunks but 
 legs  boots mostly intact;   dead horses, fifty feet,
perhaps, behind a line  four ripped guns  smashed gun carriages.

Sheen,  seemed, had escaped destruction, but  place was silent 
deserted. Here we happened on no dead, though  night was too dark
 us  see in  side roads   place.  Sheen  companion
suddenly complained  faintness  thirst,  we decided  try one
  houses.

 first house we entered, after a little difficulty   window,
was a small semi-detached villa,  I found nothing eatable left 
 place but some mouldy cheese.  was, however, water  drink;
 I took a hatchet, which promised  be useful  our next
house-breaking.

We then crossed  a place where  road turns towards Mortlake. Here
 stood a white house within a walled garden,    pantry 
 domicile we found a store  food—two loaves  bread  a pan, 
uncooked steak,   half  a ham. I give  catalogue 
precisely because,   happened, we  destined  subsist upon
 store   next fortnight. Bottled beer stood under a shelf,
   two bags  haricot beans  some limp lettuces. 
pantry opened in a kind  wash-up kitchen,    was firewood;
 was al a cupboard,  which we found nearly a dozen 
burgundy, tinned soups  salmon,  two tins  biscuits.

We sat   adjacent kitchen   dark— we dared not strike a
light— ate bread  ham,  drank beer out   same bottle. 
curate, who was still timorous  restless, was now, oddly enough, 
pushing on,  I was urging him  keep up his strength by eating when
 thing happened  was  imprison us.

“ can’t be midnight yet,” I said,  then came a blinding glare 
vivid green light. Everything   kitchen leaped out, clearly
visible  green  black,  vanished again.  then followed such
a concussion  I have never heard before  since. So close on 
heels     seem instantaneous came a thud behind , a clash
 glass, a crash  rattle  falling masonry all about us,  
plaster   ceiling came down upon us, smashing in a multitude 
fragments upon our heads. I was knocked headlong across  floor
against  oven handle  stunned. I was insensible  a long time,
 curate told ,  when I came  we   darkness again, 
he,  a face wet,  I found afterwards,  blood  a cut
forehead, was dabbing water over .

 some time I  not recollect what had happened. Then things came
  slowly. A bruise on  temple asserted itself.

“Are you better?” asked  curate  a whisper.

 last I answered him. I sat up.

“Don’t move,” he said. “ floor  covered  smashed crockery 
 dresser. You can’t possibly move without making a noise,  I
fancy _they_ are outside.”

We both sat quite silent,   we  scarcely hear each other
breathing. Everything seemed deadly still, but once something near us,
some plaster  broken brickwork, slid down  a rumbling sound.
Outside  very near was  intermittent, metallic rattle.

“!” said  curate, when presently  happened again.

“Yes,” I said. “But what  ?”

“A Martian!” said  curate.

I listened again.

“ was not like  Heat-Ray,” I said,   a time I was inclined
 think one   great fighting-machines had stumbled against 
house,  I had seen one stumble against  tower  Shepperton
Church.

Our situation was  strange  incomprehensible   three 
four hours, until  dawn came, we scarcely moved.  then  light
filtered , not through  window, which remained black, but through
a triangular aperture between a beam  a heap  broken bricks  
wall behind us.  interior   kitchen we now saw greyly  
first time.

 window had been burst  by a mass  garden mould, which flowed
over  table upon which we had been sitting  lay about our feet.
Outside,  soil was banked high against  house.   top  
window frame we  see  uprooted drainpipe.  floor was littered
 smashed hardware;  end   kitchen towards  house was
broken in,  since  daylight shone  ,  was evident 
greater part   house had collapsed. Contrasting vividly  
ruin was  neat dresser, stained   fashion, pale green,  
a number  copper  tin vessels below ,  wallpaper imitating
blue  white tiles,  a couple  coloured supplements fluttering
  walls above  kitchen range.

  dawn grew clearer, we saw through  gap   wall  body
 a Martian, standing sentinel, I suppose, over  still glowing
cylinder.   sight   we crawled  circumspectly  possible
out   twilight   kitchen in  darkness   scullery.

Abruptly  right interpretation dawned upon  mind.

“ fifth cylinder,” I whispered, “ fifth shot  Mars, has
struck  house  buried us under  ruins!”

 a time  curate was silent,  then he whispered:

“God have mercy upon us!”

I heard him presently whimpering  himself.

Save   sound we lay quite still   scullery; I   part
scarce dared brea,  sat   eyes fixed on  faint light 
 kitchen door. I  just see  curate’s face, a dim, oval
shape,  his collar  cuffs. Outside  began a metallic
hammering, then a violent hooting,  then again, after a quiet
interval, a hissing like  hissing   engine. These noises, 
 most part problematical, continued intermittently,  seemed if
anything  increase  number  time wore on. Presently a measured
thudding  a vibration  made everything about us quiver  
vessels   pantry ring  shift, began  continued. Once 
light was eclipsed,   ghostly kitchen doorway became absolutely
dark.  many hours we must have crouched , silent  shivering,
until our tired attention failed. . . .

 last I found myself awake  very hungry. I  inclined  believe
we must have spent  greater portion  a day before  awakening.
 hunger was  a stride  insistent   moved   action. I
told  curate I was going  seek food,  felt  way towards 
pantry. He made  no answer, but  soon  I began eating  faint
noise I made stirred him up  I heard him crawling after .





WHAT WE SAW   RUINED HOUSE.


After eating we crept back   scullery,   I must have dozed
again,  when presently I looked round I was alone.  thudding
vibration continued  wearisome persistence. I whispered  
curate several times,   last felt  way   door  
kitchen.  was still daylight,  I perceived him across  room,
lying against  triangular hole  looked out upon  Martians.
His shoulders  hunched,   his head was hidden  .

I  hear a number  noises almost like those   engine shed;
  place rocked   beating thud. Through  aperture 
 wall I  see  top  a tree touched  gold   warm
blue  a tranquil evening sky.  a minute   I remained watching
 curate,  then I advanced, crouching  stepping  extreme
care amid  broken crockery  littered  floor.

I touched  curate’s leg,  he started  violently  a mass 
plaster went sliding down outside  fell  a loud impact. I
gripped his arm, fearing he might cry out,   a long time we
crouched motionless. Then I turned  see how much  our rampart
remained.  detachment   plaster had left a vertical slit open
  debris,  by raising myself cautiously across a beam I was
able  see out   gap in what had been overnight a quiet
suburban roadway. st, indeed, was  change  we beheld.

 fifth cylinder must have fallen right in  midst   house
we had first visited.  building had vanished, completely smashed,
pulverised,  dispersed by  blow.  cylinder lay now far beneath
 original foundations—deep  a hole, already vastly larger than 
pit I had looked in  Woking.  earth all round  had splashed
under  tremendous impact—“splashed”   only word— lay 
heaped piles  hid  masses   adjacent houses.  had behaved
exactly like mud under  violent blow  a hammer. Our house had
collapsed backward;  front portion, even on  ground floor, had
been destroyed completely; by a chance  kitchen  scullery had
escaped,  stood buried now under soil  ruins, closed  by tons
 earth on every side save towards  cylinder. Over  aspect we
hung now on  very edge   great circular pit  Martians 
engaged  making.  heavy beating sound was evidently just behind
us,  ever  again a bright green vapour drove up like a veil
across our peephole.

 cylinder was already opened   centre   pit,  on 
farther edge   pit, amid  smashed  gravel-heaped shrubbery,
one   great fighting-machines, deserted by  occupant, stood
stiff  tall against  evening sky.  first I scarcely noticed 
pit   cylinder, although  has been convenient  describe 
first, on account   extraordinary glittering mechanism I saw busy

crawling slowly  painfully across  heaped mould near .

 motion was  swift, complex,  perfect   first I did not
see   a machine,  spite   metallic glitter. 
fighting-machines  coordinated  animated   extraordinary
pitch, but nothing  compare  . People who have never seen
these structures,  have only  ill-imagined efforts  artists 
 imperfect descriptions  such eye-witnesses  myself  go upon,
scarcely realise  living quality.

I recall particularly  illustration  one   first pamphlets

hasty study  one   fighting-machines,   his knowledge

vogue,  I mention  here simply  warn  reader against

saw  action than a Dutch doll  like a human being.   mind,

 first, I say,  handling-machine did not impress   a machine,
but  a crablike creature  a glittering integument,

then I perceived  resemblance   grey-brown, shiny, leathery

 interest shifted  those other creatures,  real Martians.
Already I had had a transient impression  these,   first nausea
no longer obscured  observation. Moreover, I was concealed 
motionless,  under no urgency  action.

 , I now saw,  most unearthly creatures   possible 
conceive.   huge round bodies—, rather, heads—about four feet
 diameter, each body having  front   a face.  face had no
nostrils—indeed,  Martians do not seem  have had any sense 
smell, but  had a pair  very large dark-coloured eyes,  just
beneath  a kind  fleshy beak.   back   head  body—I
scarcely know how  speak  —was  single tight tympanic surface,

useless  our dense air.  a group round  mouth  sixteen
slender, almost whiplike tentacles, arranged  two bunches  eight
each. These bunches have since been named rather aptly, by 
distinguished anatomist, Professor Howes,  _hands_. Even  I saw
these Martians   first time  seemed  be endeavouring 
raise themselves on these hands, but  course,   increased
weight  terrestrial conditions,  was impossible.   reason
 suppose  on Mars  may have progressed upon   some
facility.

 internal anatomy, I may remark here,  dissection has since shown,
was almost equally simple.  greater part   structure was

 while I  engaged   description, I may add   place
certain further details which, although   not all evident  us
  time, will enable  reader who  unacquainted   
form a clearer picture  these offensive creatures.

 three other points  physiology differed strangely  ours.
 organisms did not sleep, any more than  heart  man sleeps.
Since  had no extensive muscular mechanism  recuperate, 
periodical extinction was unknown  .  had little  no sense
 fatigue,   seem. On earth   never have moved without
effort, yet even   last  kept  action.  twenty-four hours
 did twenty-four hours  work,  even on earth  perhaps 
case   ants.

  next place, wonderful   seems  a sexual world, 
Martians  absolutely without sex,  therefore without any  
tumultuous emotions  arise   difference among men. A young
Martian,  can now be no dispute, was really born upon earth during
 war,   was found attached   parent, partially _budded_
off, just  young lilybulbs bud off,  like  young animals  
fresh-water polyp.

 man,  all  higher terrestrial animals, such a method 
increase has disappeared; but even on  earth  was certainly 
primitive method. Among  lower animals, up even  those first
cousins   vertebrated animals,  Tunicates,  two processes
occur side by side, but finally  sexual method superseded 
competitor altogether. On Mars, however, just  reverse has
apparently been  case.

  worthy  remark  a certain speculative writer 
quasi-scientific repute, writing long before  Martian invasion, did
forecast  man a final structure not unlike  actual Martian
condition. His prophecy, I remember, appeared  November  December,
1893,  a long-defunct publication,  _Pall Mall Budget_,  I
recall a caricature    a pre-Martian periodical called _Punch_.
He pointed out—writing  a foolish, facetious tone—  perfection
 mechanical appliances must ultimately supersede limbs; 
perfection  chemical devices, digestion;  such organs  hair,
external nose, teeth, ears,  chin  no longer essential parts

 brain alone remained a cardinal necessity. Only one other part 
 body had a strong case  survival,   was  h,
“teacher  agent   brain.” While  rest   body dwindled,
 hands  grow larger.

  many a true word written  jest,  here   Martians we
have beyond dispute  actual accomplishment  such a suppression

credible   Martians may be descended  beings not unlike
ourselves, by a gradual development  brain  hands ( latter
giving rise   two bunches  delicate tentacles  last)

course, become a mere selfish intelligence, without any  
emotional substratum   human being.

 last salient point  which  systems  these creatures differed
 ours was  what one might have thought a very trivial particular.
Micro-organisms, which cause  much disease  pain on earth, have
either never appeared upon Mars  Martian sanitary science eliminated
 ages ago. A hundred diseases, all  fevers  contagions 
human life, consumption, cancers, tumours  such morbidities, never
enter  scheme   life.  speaking   differences between
 life on Mars  terrestrial life, I may allude here   curious
suggestions   red weed.

Apparently  vegetable kingdom  Mars, instead  having green  a
dominant colour,   a vivid blood-red tint.  any rate,  seeds
which  Martians (intentionally  accidentally) brought  
gave rise  all cases  red-coloured growths. Only  known
popularly   red weed, however, gained any footing  competition

 few people have seen  growing.  a time, however,  red weed
grew  astonishing vigour  luxuriance.  spread up  sides

 DAYS OF IMPRISONMENT.

 life was  stop   house until  Martians had done

 need food. He ate  drank impulsively  heavy meals  long

 while within we fought out our dark, dim contest  whispers,
snatched food  drink,  gripping hands  blows, without,  
pitiless sunlight   terrible June, was  strange wonder, 
unfamiliar routine   Martians   pit. Let  return  those

occupants  no fewer than three   fighting-machines. These last

completed,  was busied  serving one   novel contrivances 
big machine had brought.  was a body resembling a milk can  
general form, above which oscillated a pear-shaped receptacle,  
which a stream  white powder flowed in a circular basin below.

 oscillatory motion was imparted   by one tentacle

Another steely tentacle directed  powder   basin along a

green smoke rose vertically in  quiet air.  I looked, 
handling-machine,  a faint  musical clinking, extended,
telescopic fashion, a tentacle  had been a moment before a mere
blunt projection, until  end was hidden behind  mound  clay. 
another second  had lifted a bar  white aluminium in sight,

growing stack  bars  stood   side   pit. Between sunset

steadily until  topped  side   pit.

 contrast between  swift  complex movements  these
contrivances   inert panting clumsiness   masters was
acute,   days I had  tell myself repeatedly  these latter

 curate had possession   slit when  first men  brought
  pit. I was sitting below, huddled up, listening  all 
ears. He made a sudden movement backward,  I, fearful  we 
observed, crouched  a spasm  terror. He came sliding down 
rubbish  crept beside    darkness, inarticulate,
gesticulating,   a moment I shared his panic. His gesture
suggested a resignation   slit,  after a little while 
curiosity gave  courage,  I rose up, stepped across him, 
clambered up  .  first I  see no reason  his frantic
behaviour.  twilight had now come,  stars  little  faint,
but  pit was illuminated by  flickering green fire  came

eyes. Over  through  all went  bats, heeding  not  all. 
sprawling Martians  no longer  be seen,  mound  blue-green
powder had risen  cover   sight,  a fighting-machine, 
 legs contracted, crumpled,  abbreviated, stood across  corner
  pit.  then, amid  clangour   machinery, came a
drifting suspicion  human voices,  I entertained  first only

I crouched, watching  fighting-machine closely, satisfying myself
now   first time   hood did indeed contain a Martian. 
 green flames lifted I  see  oily gleam  his integument
  brightness  his eyes.  suddenly I heard a yell,  saw a
long tentacle reaching over  shoulder   machine   little
cage  hunched upon  back. Then something—something struggling
violently—was lifted high against  sky, a black, vague enigma
against  starlight;    black object came down again, I saw
by  green brightness   was a man.   instant he was
clearly visible. He was a stout, ruddy, middle-aged man, well dressed;
three days before, he must have been walking  world, a man 
considerable consequence. I  see his staring eyes  gleams 
light on his studs  watch chain. He vanished behind  mound, 
 a moment  was silence.  then began a shrieking  a
sustained  cheerful hooting   Martians.

I slid down  rubbish, struggled   feet, clapped  hands over 
ears,  bolted in  scullery.  curate, who had been crouching
silently  his arms over his head, looked up  I passed, cried out
quite loudly   desertion  him,  came running after .

 night,  we lurked   scullery, balanced between our horror

but afterwards, during  second day, I was able  consider our
position  great clearness.  curate, I found, was quite incapable

 level   animal. But   saying goes, I gripped myself 
both hands.  grew upon  mind, once I  face  facts, 
terrible  our position was,  was  yet no justification 
absolute despair. Our chief chance lay   possibility  
Martians making  pit nothing more than a temporary encampment. 
even if  kept  permanently,  might not consider  necessary
 guard ,  a chance  escape might be afforded us. I al
weighed very carefully  possibility  our digging a way out  a
direction away   pit, but  chances  our emerging within
sight  some sentinel fighting-machine seemed  first too great. 
I  have had  do all  digging myself.  curate 
certainly have failed .

 was on  third day, if  memory serves  right,  I saw 
lad killed.  was  only occasion on which I actually saw 
Martians feed. After  experience I avoided  hole   wall

 spent some hours digging   hatchet  silently  possible;
but when I had made a hole about a couple  feet deep  loose earth
collapsed noisily,  I did not dare continue. I lost heart,  lay
down on  scullery floor  a long time, having no spirit even 
move.  after  I abandoned altogether  idea  escaping by
excavation.

by  overthrow through any human effort. But on  fourth  fifth
night I heard a sound like heavy guns.

made  listen. Then I heard quite distinctly a booming exactly like
 sound  great guns. Six distinct reports I counted,  after a
long interval six again.   was all.





 DEATH OF  CURATE.


 was on  sixth day  our imprisonment  I peeped   last
time,  presently found myself alone. Instead  keeping close  
 trying  oust    slit,  curate had gone back in 
scullery. I was struck by a sudden thought. I went back quickly 
quietly in  scullery.   darkness I heard  curate drinking.
I snatched   darkness,   fingers caught a bottle  burgundy.

 a few minutes  was a tussle.  bottle struck  floor 
broke,  I desisted  rose. We stood panting  threatening each
other.   end I planted myself between him   food,  told
him   determination  begin a discipline. I divided  food 
 pantry, in rations  last us ten days. I  not let him eat
any more  day.   afternoon he made a feeble effort  get 
 food. I had been dozing, but   instant I was awake. All day 
all night we sat face  face, I weary but resolute,  he weeping 
complaining  his immediate hunger.  was, I know, a night  a day,
but    seemed— seems now— interminable length  time.

  our widened incompatibility ended  last  open conflict. 
two vast days we struggled  undertones  wrestling contests. 
 times when I beat  kicked him madly, times when I cajoled 
persuaded him,  once I tried  bribe him   last bottle 
burgundy,   was a rain-water pump  which I  get water.
But neither force nor kindness availed; he was indeed beyond reason. He
 neither desist  his attacks on  food nor  his noisy
babbling  himself.  rudimentary precautions  keep our
imprisonment endurable he  not observe. Slowly I began  realise
 complete overthrow  his intelligence,  perceive   sole
companion   close  sickly darkness was a man insane.

 certain vague memories I  inclined  think  own mind wandered
 times. I had strange  hideous dreams whenever I slept.  sounds
paradoxical, but I  inclined  think   weakness  insanity
  curate warned , braced ,  kept  a sane man.

On  eighth day he began  talk aloud instead  whispering, 
nothing I  do  moderate his speech.

“  just, O God!” he  say, over  over again. “  just. On
  mine be  punishment laid. We have sinned, we have fallen
short.  was poverty, sorrow;  poor  trodden   dust,
 I held  peace. I preached acceptable folly— God, what
folly!—when I  have stood up, though I died  ,  called
upon   repent—repent! . . . Oppressors   poor  needy . .
. !  wine press  God!”

Then he  suddenly revert   matter   food I withheld 
him, praying, begging, weeping,  last threatening. He began  raise
his voice—I prayed him not . He perceived a hold on —he threatened
he  shout  bring  Martians upon us.  a time  scared
; but any concession  have shortened our chance  escape beyond
estimating. I defied him, although I felt no assurance  he might
not do  thing. But  day,  any rate, he did not. He talked
 his voice rising slowly, through  greater part   eighth
 ninth days—threats, entreaties, mingled  a torrent  half-sane
 always frothy repentance  his vacant sham  God’s service, such
 made  pity him. Then he slept awhile,  began again  renewed
strength,  loudly  I must needs make him desist.

“Be still!” I implored.

He rose  his knees,  he had been sitting   darkness near 
copper.

“I have been still too long,” he said,  a tone  must have reached
 pit, “ now I must bear  witness. Woe un  unfaithful
city! Woe! Woe! Woe! Woe! Woe!   inhabitants   earth by
reason   other voices   trumpet——”

“Shut up!” I said, rising   feet,   a terror lest  Martians
 hear us. “ God’s sake——”

“Nay,” shouted  curate,   top  his voice, standing likewise
 extending his arms. “Speak!  word   Lord  upon !”

 three strides he was   door leading in  kitchen.

“I must bear  witness! I go!  has already been too long delayed.”

I put out  h  felt  meat chopper hanging   wall.  a
flash I was after him. I was fierce  fear. Before he was halfway
across  kitchen I had overtaken him.  one last touch  humanity
I turned  blade back  struck him   butt. He went headlong
forward  lay stretched on  ground. I stumbled over him  stood
panting. He lay still.

Suddenly I heard a noise without,  run  smash  slipping
plaster,   triangular aperture   wall was darkened. I looked
up  saw  lower surface  a handling-machine coming slowly across
 hole. One   gripping limbs curled amid  debris; another
limb appeared, feeling  way over  fallen beams. I stood
petrified, staring. Then I saw through a sort  glass plate near 
edge   body  face,  we may call ,   large dark eyes
 a Martian, peering,  then a long metallic snake  tentacle came
feeling slowly through  hole.

I turned by  effort, stumbled over  curate,  stopped  
scullery door.  tentacle was now some way, two yards  more,  
room,  twisting  turning,  queer sudden movements,  way
 .  a while I stood fascinated by  slow, fitful advance.
Then,  a faint, hoarse cry, I forced myself across  scullery. I
trembled violently; I  scarcely st upright. I opened  door
  coal cellar,  stood    darkness staring  
faintly lit doorway in  kitchen,  listening. Had  Martian
seen ? What was  doing now?

Something was moving   fro , very quietly; every now  then
 tapped against  wall,  started on  movements  a faint
metallic ringing, like  movements  keys on a split-ring. Then a
heavy body—I knew too well what—was dragged across  floor  
kitchen towards  opening. Irresistibly attracted, I crept  
door  peeped in  kitchen.   triangle  bright outer
sunlight I saw  Martian,   Briareus  a handling-machine,
scrutinizing  curate’s head. I thought  once    infer
 presence   mark   blow I had given him.

I crept back   coal cellar, shut  door,  began  cover
myself up  much  I ,   noiselessly  possible  
darkness, among  firewood  coal therein. Every now  then I
paused, rigid,  hear if  Martian had thrust  tentacles through
 opening again.

Then  faint metallic jingle returned. I traced  slowly feeling
over  kitchen. Presently I heard  nearer—  scullery,  I
judged. I thought   length might be insufficient  reach . I
prayed copiously.  passed, scraping faintly across  cellar door.
 age  almost intolerable suspense intervened; then I heard 
fumbling   latch!  had found  door!  Martians understood
doors!

 worried   catch  a minute, perhaps,  then  door
opened.

  darkness I  just see  thing—like  elephant’s trunk
more than anything else—waving towards   touching  examining
 wall, coals, wood  ceiling.  was like a black worm swaying 
blind head   fro.

Once, even,  touched  heel   boot. I was on  verge 
screaming; I bit  h.  a time  tentacle was silent. I 
have fancied  had been withdrawn. Presently,   abrupt click, 
gripped something—I thought  had !— seemed  go out  
cellar again.  a minute I was not sure. Apparently  had taken a
lump  coal  examine.

I seized  opportunity  slightly shifting  position, which had
become cramped,  then listened. I whispered passionate prayers 
safety.

Then I heard  slow, deliberate sound creeping towards  again.
Slowly, slowly  drew near, scratching against  walls  tapping
 furniture.

While I was still doubtful,  rapped smartly against  cellar door
 closed . I heard  go in  pantry,   biscuit-tins
rattled  a bottle smashed,  then came a heavy bump against 
cellar door. Then silence  passed in  infinity  suspense.

Had  gone?

 last I decided   had.

 came in  scullery no more; but I lay all  tenth day  
close darkness, buried among coals  firewood, not daring even 
crawl out   drink  which I craved.  was  eleventh day
before I ventured  far   security.





 STILLNESS.


 first act before I went in  pantry was  fasten  door
between  kitchen   scullery. But  pantry was empty; every
scrap  food had gone. Apparently,  Martian had taken  all on 
previous day.   discovery I despaired   first time. I took
no food,  no drink either, on  eleventh   twelfth day.

 first  mouth  throat  parched,   strength ebbed
sensibly. I sat about   darkness   scullery,  a state 
despondent wretchedness.  mind ran on eating. I thought I had become
deaf,   noises  movement I had been accustomed  hear  
pit had ceased absolutely. I did not feel strong enough  crawl
noiselessly   peephole,  I  have gone .

On  twelfth day  throat was  painful , taking  chance 
alarming  Martians, I attacked  creaking rain-water pump 
stood by  sink,  got a couple  glassfuls  blackened 
tainted rain water. I was greatly refreshed by ,  emboldened by
 fact  no enquiring tentacle followed  noise   pumping.

During these days,  a rambling, inconclusive way, I thought much 
 curate    manner  his death.

On  thirteenth day I drank some more water,  dozed  thought
disjointedly  eating   vague impossible plans  escape.
Whenever I dozed I dreamt  horrible phantasms,   death  
curate,   sumptuous dinners; but, asleep  awake, I felt a keen
pain  urged   drink again  again.  light  came in
 scullery was no longer grey, but red.   disordered imagination
 seemed  colour  blood.

On  fourteenth day I went in  kitchen,  I was surprised 
find   fronds   red weed had grown right across  hole 
 wall, turning  half-light   place in a crimson-coloured
obscurity.

 was early on  fifteenth day  I heard a curious, familiar
sequence  sounds   kitchen, , listening, identified   
snuffing  scratching  a dog. Going in  kitchen, I saw a dog’s
nose peering  through a break among  ruddy fronds.  greatly
surprised .   scent   he barked shortly.

I thought if I  induce him  come in  place quietly I 
be able, perhaps,  kill  eat him;   any case,   be
advisable  kill him, lest his actions attracted  attention  
Martians.

I crept forward, saying “Good dog!” very softly; but he suddenly
withdrew his head  disappeared.

I listened—I was not deaf—but certainly  pit was still. I heard a
sound like  flutter  a bird’s wings,  a hoarse croaking, but
 was all.

 a long while I lay close   peephole, but not daring  move
aside  red plants  obscured . Once  twice I heard a faint
pitter-patter like  feet   dog going hither  thither on 
s far below ,    more birdlike sounds, but  was
all.  length, encouraged by  silence, I looked out.

Except   corner, where a multitude  crows hopped  fought over
 skeletons   dead  Martians had consumed,  was not a
living thing   pit.

I stared about , scarcely believing  eyes. All  machinery had
gone. Save   big mound  greyish-blue powder  one corner,
certain bars  aluminium  another,  black birds,  
skeletons   killed,  place was merely  empty circular pit 
 s.

Slowly I thrust myself out through  red weed,  stood upon 
mound  rubble. I  see  any direction save behind ,  
north,  neither Martians nor sign  Martians   be seen. 
pit dropped sheerly   feet, but a little way along  rubbish
afforded a practicable slope   summit   ruins.  chance 
escape had come. I began  tremble.

I hesitated  some time,  then,  a gust  desperate resolution,
  a heart  throbbed violently, I scrambled   top  
mound  which I had been buried  long.

I looked about again.   northward, too, no Martian was visible.

When I had last seen  part  Sheen   daylight  had been a
straggling street  comfortable white  red houses, interspersed
 abundant shady trees. Now I stood on a mound  smashed brickwork,
clay,  gravel, over which spread a multitude  red cactus-shaped
plants, knee-high, without a solitary terrestrial growth  dispute
 footing.  trees near   dead  brown, but further a
network  red thread scaled  still living stems.

 neighbouring houses had all been wrecked, but none had been burned;
 walls stood, sometimes   second story,  smashed windows
 shattered doors.  red weed grew tumultuously   roofless
rooms. Below  was  great pit,   crows struggling  
refuse. A number  other birds hopped about among  ruins. Far away
I saw a gaunt cat slink crouchingly along a wall, but traces  men
  none.

 day seemed, by contrast   recent confinement, dazzlingly
bright,  sky a glowing blue. A gentle breeze kept  red weed 
covered every scrap  unoccupied ground gently swaying.  oh! 
sweetness   air!





 WORK OF FIFTEEN DAYS.


 some time I stood tottering on  mound regardless   safety.
Within  noisome den  which I had emerged I had thought  a
narrow intensity only  our immediate security. I had not realised
what had been happening   world, had not anticipated 
startling vision  unfamiliar things. I had expected  see Sheen 
ruins—I found about   landscape, weird  lurid,  another
planet.

  moment I touched  emotion beyond  common range  men,
yet one   poor brutes we dominate know only too well. I felt 
a rabbit might feel returning  his burrow  suddenly confronted by
 work  a dozen busy navvies digging  foundations  a house. I
felt  first inkling  a thing  presently grew quite clear  
mind,  oppressed   many days, a sense  dethronement, a
persuasion  I was no longer a master, but  animal among 
animals, under  Martian heel.  us   be   , 
lurk  watch,  run  hide;  fear  empire  man had passed
away.

But  soon   strangeness had been realised  passed,  
dominant motive became  hunger   long  dismal fast.  
direction away   pit I saw, beyond a red-covered wall, a patch
 garden ground unburied.  gave  a hint,  I went knee-deep,
 sometimes neck-deep,   red weed.  density   weed gave
 a reassuring sense  hiding.  wall was some six feet high, 
when I attempted  clamber  I found I  not lift  feet  
crest. So I went along by  side  ,  came  a corner  a
rockwork  enabled   get   top,  tumble in  garden
I coveted. Here I found some young onions, a couple  gladiolus bulbs,
 a quantity  immature carrots, all  which I secured, ,
scrambling over a ruined wall, went on  way through scarlet 
crimson trees towards Kew— was like walking through  avenue 
gigantic blood drops—possessed  two ideas:  get more food,  
limp,  soon   far   strength permitted, out   accursed
unearthly region   pit.

Some way farther,  a grassy place, was a group  mushrooms which
al I devoured,  then I came upon a brown sheet  flowing shallow
water, where meadows used  be. These fragments  nourishment served
only  whet  hunger.  first I was surprised   flood  a
hot, dry summer, but afterwards I discovered   was caused by 
tropical exuberance   red weed. Directly  extraordinary growth
encountered water  straightway became gigantic   unparalleled
fecundity.  seeds  simply poured down in  water   Wey

choked both those rivers.

 Putney,  I afterwards saw,  bridge was almost lost  a tangle

 shallow stream across  meadows  Hampton  Twickenham.  
water spread  weed followed , until  ruined villas  
Thames valley   a time lost   red swamp, whose margin I
explored,  much   desolation  Martians had caused was
concealed.

  end  red weed succumbed almost  quickly   had spread. A
cankering disease, due,   believed,   action  certain
bacteria, presently seized upon . Now by  action  natural
selection, all terrestrial plants have acquired a resisting power
against bacterial diseases— never succumb without a severe
struggle, but  red weed rotted like a thing already dead.  fronds
became bleached,  then shrivelled  brittle.  broke off  
least touch,   waters  had stimulated  early growth
carried  last vestiges out  sea.

 first act on coming   water was,  course,  slake 
thirst. I drank a great deal   , moved by  impulse, gnawed
some fronds  red weed; but   watery,  had a sickly,
metallic taste. I found  water was sufficiently shallow   
wade securely, although  red weed impeded  feet a little; but 
flood evidently got deeper towards  river,  I turned back 
Mortlake. I managed  make out  road by means  occasional ruins

Here  scenery changed   strange  unfamiliar

undisturbed spaces, houses   blinds trimly drawn  doors

tall trees along  lane  free   red creeper. I hunted 
food among  trees, finding nothing,  I al raided a couple 
silent houses, but  had already been broken in  ransacked. I
rested   remainder   daylight  a shrubbery, being,  
enfeebled condition, too fatigued  push on.

All  time I saw no human beings,  no signs   Martians. I
encountered a couple  hungry-looking dogs, but both hurried
circuitously away   advances I made . Near Roehampton I had
seen two human skeletons—not bodies, but skeletons, picked clean— 
 wood by  I found  crushed  scattered bones  several cats
 rabbits   skull  a sheep. But though I gnawed parts 
these   mouth,  was nothing  be got  .

After sunset I struggled on along  road towards Putney, where I
think  Heat-Ray must have been used  some reason.   
garden beyond Roehampton I got a quantity  immature potatoes,
sufficient  stay  hunger.   garden one looked down upon
Putney   river.  aspect   place   dusk was
singularly desolate: blackened trees, blackened, desolate ruins, 
down  hill  sheets   flooded river, red-tinged  
weed.  over all—silence.  filled   indescribable terror 
think how swiftly  desolating change had come.

 a time I believed  mankind had been swept out  existence, 
 I stood  alone,  last man left alive. Hard by  top 
Putney Hill I came upon another skeleton,   arms dislocated 
removed several yards   rest   body.  I proceeded I
became more  more convinced   extermination  mankind was,
save  such stragglers  myself, already accomplished   part
  world.  Martians, I thought, had gone on  left  country
desolated, seeking food elsewhere. Perhaps even now  
destroying Berlin  Paris,   might be  had gone northward.




.
 MAN ON PUTNEY HILL.


I spent  night   inn  stands   top  Putney Hill,
sleeping  a made bed   first time since  flight 
Leatherhead. I will not tell  needless trouble I had breaking in
 house—afterwards I found  front door was on  latch—nor how I
ransacked every room  food, until just on  verge  despair, 
what seemed    be a servant’s bedroom, I found a rat-gnawed crust
 two tins  pineapple.  place had been already searched 
emptied.   bar I afterwards found some biscuits  sandwiches
 had been overlooked.  latter I  not eat,   too
rotten, but  former not only stayed  hunger, but filled 
pockets. I lit no lamps, fearing some Martian might come beating 
part  London  food   night. Before I went  bed I had 
interval  restlessness,  prowled  window  window, peering
out  some sign  these monsters. I slept little.  I lay  bed I
found myself thinking consecutively—a thing I do not remember  have
done since  last argument   curate. During all  intervening
time  mental condition had been a hurrying succession  vague
emotional states  a sort  stupid receptivity. But   night 
brain, reinforced, I suppose, by  food I had eaten, grew clear
again,  I thought.

Three things struggled  possession   mind:  killing  
curate,  whereabouts   Martians,   possible fate  
wife.  former gave  no sensation  horror  remorse  recall; I
saw  simply  a thing done, a memory infinitely disagreeable but
quite without  quality  remorse. I saw myself then  I see myself
now, driven step by step towards  hasty blow,  creature  a
sequence  accidents leading inevitably  . I felt no
condemnation; yet  memory, static, unprogressive, haunted .  
silence   night,   sense   nearness  God 
sometimes comes in  stillness   darkness, I stood  trial,
 only trial,   moment  wrath  fear. I retraced every step
 our conversation   moment when I had found him crouching
beside , heedless   thirst,  pointing   fire  smoke
 streamed up   ruins  Weybridge. We had been incapable 
co-operation—grim chance had taken no heed  . Had I foreseen, I
 have left him  Halliford. But I did not foresee;  crime 
 foresee  do.  I set  down  I have set all  story
down,   was.   no witnesses—all these things I might have
concealed. But I set  down,   reader must form his judgment 
he will.

 when, by  effort, I had set aside  picture  a prostrate
body, I faced  problem   Martians   fate   wife. 
 former I had no data; I  imagine a hundred things,  ,
unhappily, I    latter.  suddenly  night became
terrible. I found myself sitting up  bed, staring   dark. I
found myself praying   Heat-Ray might have suddenly 
painlessly struck her out  being. Since  night   return 
Leatherhead I had not prayed. I had uttered prayers, fetish prayers,
had prayed  heathens mutter charms when I was  extremity; but now I
prayed indeed, pleading steadfastly  sanely, face  face  
darkness  God. Strange night! Strangest  ,   soon  dawn
had come, I, who had talked  God, crept out   house like a rat
leaving  hiding place—a creature scarcely larger,  inferior
animal, a thing   any passing whim  our masters might be
hunted  killed. Perhaps  al prayed confidently  God. Surely,
if we have learned nothing else,  war has taught us pity—pity 
those witless souls  suffer our dominion.

 morning was bright  fine,   eastern sky glowed pink, 
was fretted  little golden clouds.   road  runs  
top  Putney Hill  Wimbledon was a number  poor vestiges  
panic torrent  must have poured Londonward on  Sunday night
after  fighting began.  was a little two-wheeled cart inscribed
  name  Thomas Lobb, Greengrocer, New Malden,  a smashed
wheel   abandoned tin trunk;  was a straw hat trampled in
 now hardened mud,    top  West Hill a lot 
blood-stained glass about  overturned water trough.  movements
 languid,  plans   vaguest. I had  idea  going 
Leatherhead, though I knew   I had  poorest chance 
finding  wife. Certainly, unless death had overtaken  suddenly,
 cousins  she  have fled thence; but  seemed   I might
find  learn  whither  Surrey people had fled. I knew I wanted
 find  wife,   heart ached  her   world  men, but
I had no clear idea how  finding might be done. I was al sharply
aware now   intense loneliness.   corner I went, under cover
 a thicket  trees  bushes,   edge  Wimbledon Common,
stretching wide  far.

 dark expanse was lit  patches by yellow gorse  broom; 
was no red weed  be seen,   I prowled, hesitating, on  verge
  open,  sun rose, flooding  all  light  vitality. I
came upon a busy swarm  little frogs  a swampy place among 
trees. I stopped  look  , drawing a lesson   stout
resolve  live.  presently, turning suddenly,   odd feeling
 being watched, I beheld something crouching amid a clump  bushes.
I stood regarding . I made a step towards ,   rose up 
became a man armed  a cutlass. I approached him slowly. He stood
silent  motionless, regarding .

 I drew nearer I perceived he was dressed  clothes  dusty 
filthy   own; he looked, indeed,  though he had been dragged
through a culvert. Nearer, I distinguished  green slime  ditches
mixing   pale drab  dried clay  shiny, coaly patches. His
black hair fell over his eyes,  his face was dark  dirty 
sunken,    first I did not recognise him.  was a red cut
across  lower part  his face.

“Stop!” he cried, when I was within ten yards  him,  I stopped.
His voice was hoarse. “Where do you come ?” he said.

I thought, surveying him.

“I come  Mortlake,” I said. “I was buried near  pit  Martians
made about  cylinder. I have worked  way out  escaped.”

“  no food about here,” he said. “   country. All 
hill down   river,  back  Clapham,  up   edge  
common.   only food  one. Which way are you going?”

I answered slowly.

“I don’t know,” I said. “I have been buried   ruins  a house
thirteen  fourteen days. I don’t know what has happened.”

He looked   doubtfully, then started,  looked  a changed
expression.

“I’ve no wish  stop about here,” said I. “I think I shall go 
Leatherhead,   wife was .”

He shot out a pointing finger.

“  you,” said he; “ man  Woking.  you weren’t killed 
Weybridge?”

I recognised him   same moment.

“You are  artilleryman who came in  garden.”

“Good luck!” he said. “We are lucky ones! Fancy _you_!” He put out a
h,  I took . “I crawled up a drain,” he said. “But  didn’t
kill everyone.  after  went away I got off towards Walton across
 fields. But—— ’s not sixteen days altogether— your hair 
grey.” He looked over his shoulder suddenly. “Only a rook,” he said.
“One gets  know  birds have shadows these days.   a bit
open. Let us crawl under those bushes  talk.”

“Have you seen any Martians?” I said. “Since I crawled out——”

“’ve gone away across London,” he said. “I guess ’ve got a
bigger camp . Of a night, all over , Hampstead way,  sky
 alive   lights. ’s like a great city,    glare
you can just see  moving. By daylight you can’t. But nearer—I
haven’t seen —” (he counted on his fingers) “five days. Then I saw
a couple across Hammersmith way carrying something big.   night
before last”—he stopped  spoke impressively—“ was just a matter 
lights, but  was something up   air. I believe ’ve built a
flying-machine,  are learning  fly.”

I stopped, on hands  knees,  we had come   bushes.

“Fly!”

“Yes,” he said, “fly.”

I went on in a little bower,  sat down.

“  all over  humanity,” I said. “If  can do   will
simply go round  world.”

He nodded.

“ will. But——  will relieve things over here a bit. 
besides——” He looked  . “Aren’t you satisfied  _is_ up 
humanity? I . We’re down; we’re beat.”

I stared. Strange   may seem, I had not arrived   fact—a fact
perfectly obvious  soon  he spoke. I had still held a vague hope;
rather, I had kept a lifelong habit  mind. He repeated his words,
“We’re beat.”  carried absolute conviction.

“’s all over,” he said. “’ve lost _one_—just _one_.  ’ve
made  footing good  crippled  greatest power   world.
’ve walked over us.  death   one  Weybridge was 
accident.  these are only pioneers.  kept on coming. These green
stars—I’ve seen none these five  six days, but I’ve no doubt ’re
falling somewhere every night. Nothing’s  be done. We’re under! We’re
beat!”

I made him no answer. I sat staring before , trying  vain  devise
some countervailing thought.

“ isn’t a war,” said  artilleryman. “ never was a war, any
more than ’s war between man  ants.”

Suddenly I recalled  night   observatory.

“After  tenth shot  fired no more— least, until  first
cylinder came.”

“How do you know?” said  artilleryman. I explained. He thought.
“Something wrong   gun,” he said. “But what if  ? ’ll
get  right again.  even if ’s a delay, how can  alter 
end? ’s just men  ants. ’s  ants builds  cities, live
 lives, have wars, revolutions, until  men want  out  
way,  then  go out   way. ’s what we are now—just ants.
Only——”

“Yes,” I said.

“We’re eatable ants.”

We sat looking  each other.

“ what will  do  us?” I said.

“’s what I’ve been thinking,” he said; “’s what I’ve been
thinking. After Weybridge I went south—thinking. I saw what was up.
Most   people  hard   squealing  exciting themselves.
But I’m not  fond  squealing. I’ve been  sight  death once 
twice; I’m not  ornamental soldier,    best  worst,
death—’s just death.  ’s  man  keeps on thinking comes
through. I saw everyone tracking away south. Says I, ‘Food won’t last
 way,’  I turned right back. I went   Martians like a
sparrow goes  man. All round”—he waved a h  
horizon—“’re starving  heaps, bolting, treading on each other. .
. .”

He saw  face,  halted awkwardly.

“No doubt lots who had money have gone away  France,” he said. He
seemed  hesitate whether  apologise, met  eyes,  went on:
“’s food all about here. Canned things  shops; wines, spirits,
mineral waters;   water mains  drains are empty. Well, I was
telling you what I was thinking. ‘Here’s intelligent things,’ I said,
‘  seems  want us  food. First, ’ll smash us up—ships,
machines, guns, cities, all  order  organisation. All  will
go. If we   size  ants we might pull through. But we’re not.
’s all too bulky  stop. ’s  first certainty.’ Eh?”

I assented.

“ ; I’ve thought  out. ry well, then—next;  present we’re
caught  we’re wanted. A Martian has only  go a few miles  get a
crowd on  run.  I saw one, one day, out by Wandsworth, picking
houses  pieces  routing among  wreckage. But  won’t keep on
doing . So soon  ’ve settled all our guns  ships, 
smashed our railways,  done all  things  are doing over
,  will begin catching us systematic, picking  best 
storing us  cages  things. ’s what  will start doing  a
bit. Lord!  haven’t begun on us yet. Don’t you see ?”

“Not begun!” I exclaimed.

“Not begun. All ’s happened  far  through our not having 
sense  keep quiet—worrying   guns  such foolery. 
losing our heads,  rushing off  crowds  where  wasn’t any
more safety than where we .  don’t want  bother us yet.
’re making  things—making all  things  couldn’t bring
 , getting things ready   rest   people. ry
likely ’s why  cylinders have stopped  a bit,  fear 
hitting those who are here.  instead  our rushing about blind, on
 howl,  getting dynamite on  chance  busting  up, we’ve
got  fix ourselves up according   new state  affairs. ’s
how I figure  out.  isn’t quite according  what a man wants 
his species, but ’s about what  facts point .  ’s 
principle I acted upon. Cities, nations, civilisation, progress—’s
all over.  game’s up. We’re beat.”

“But if   , what    live ?”

 artilleryman looked    a moment.

“ won’t be any more blessed concerts  a million years  ;
 won’t be any Royal Academy  Arts,  no nice little feeds 
restaurants. If ’s amusement you’re after, I reckon  game  up.
If you’ve got any drawing-room manners  a dislike  eating peas 
a knife  dropping aitches, you’d better chuck ’em away.  ain’t no
further use.”

“You mean——”

“I mean  men like  are going on living—  sake   breed.
I tell you, I’m grim set on living.  if I’m not mistaken, you’ll
show what insides _you’ve_ got, too, before long. We aren’t going  be
exterminated.  I don’t mean  be caught either,  tamed 
fattened  bred like a thundering ox. Ugh! Fancy those brown
creepers!”

“You don’t mean  say——”

“I do. I’m going on, under  feet. I’ve got  planned; I’ve
thought  out. We men are beat. We don’t know enough. We’ve got 
learn before we’ve got a chance.  we’ve got  live  keep
independent while we learn. See! ’s what has  be done.”

I stared, astonished,  stirred profoundly by  man’s resolution.

“Great God!” cried I. “But you are a man indeed!”  suddenly I
gripped his h.

“Eh!” he said,  his eyes shining. “I’ve thought  out, eh?”

“Go on,” I said.

“Well, those who mean  escape  catching must get ready. I’m
getting ready. Mind you,  isn’t all  us  are made  wild
beasts;  ’s what ’s got  be. ’s why I watched you. I had
 doubts. You’re slender. I didn’t know   was you, you see, 
just how you’d been buried. All these— sort  people  lived 
these houses,  all those damn little clerks  used  live down
_that_ way—’d be no good.  haven’t any spirit  —no proud
dreams  no proud lusts;  a man who hasn’t one   other—Lord!
What  he but funk  precautions?  just used  skedaddle off 
work—I’ve seen hundreds  ’em, bit  breakfast  h, running wild
 shining  catch  little season-ticket train,  fear ’d
get dismissed if  didn’t; working  businesses   afraid 
take  trouble  underst; skedaddling back  fear  wouldn’t
be  time  dinner; keeping indoors after dinner  fear  
back streets,  sleeping   wives  married, not because
 wanted , but because  had a bit  money   make
 safety   one little miserable skedaddle through  world.
Lives insured  a bit invested  fear  accidents.  on
Sundays—fear   hereafter.  if hell was built  rabbits! Well,
 Martians will just be a godsend  these. Nice roomy cages,
fattening food, careful breeding, no worry. After a week   chasing
about  fields  lands on empty stomachs, ’ll come  be
caught cheerful. ’ll be quite glad after a bit. ’ll wonder what
people did before   Martians  take care  .   bar
loafers,  mashers,  singers—I can imagine . I can imagine
,” he said,  a sort  sombre gratification. “’ll be any
amount  sentiment  religion loose among . ’s hundreds 
things I saw   eyes  I’ve only begun  see clearly these
last few days. ’s lots will take things   are—fat 
stupid;  lots will be worried by a sort  feeling  ’s all
wrong,    ought  be doing something. Now whenever things
are   a lot  people feel  ought  be doing something, 
weak,  those who go weak  a lot  complicated thinking, always
make  a sort  do-nothing religion, very pious  superior, 
submit  persecution   will   Lord. ry likely you’ve seen
 same thing. ’s energy  a gale  funk,  turned clean inside
out. These cages will be full  psalms  hymns  piety.  those
 a less simple sort will work  a bit —what  ?—eroticism.”

He paused.

“ry likely these Martians will make pets  some  ; train 
 do tricks—who knows?—get sentimental over  pet boy who grew up
 had  be killed.  some, maybe,  will train  hunt us.”

“No,” I cried, “’s impossible! No human being——”

“What’s  good  going on  such lies?” said  artilleryman.
“’s men who’d do  cheerful. What nonsense  pretend 
isn’t!”

 I succumbed  his conviction.

“If  come after ,” he said; “Lord, if  come after !” 
subsided in a grim meditation.

I sat contemplating these things. I  find nothing  bring against
 man’s reasoning.   days before  invasion no one  have
questioned  intellectual superiority  his—I, a professed 
recognised writer on philosophical themes,  he, a common soldier;
 yet he had already formulated a situation  I had scarcely
realised.

“What are you doing?” I said presently. “What plans have you made?”

He hesitated.

“Well, ’s like ,” he said. “What have we  do? We have  invent
a sort  life where men can live  breed,  be sufficiently secure
 bring  children up. Yes—wait a bit,  I’ll make  clearer what
I think ought  be done.  tame ones will go like all tame beasts;
 a few generations ’ll be big, beautiful, rich-blooded,
stupid—rubbish!  risk   we who keep wild will go
savage—degenerate in a sort  big, savage rat. . . . You see, how I
mean  live  underground. I’ve been thinking about  drains. Of
course those who don’t know drains think horrible things; but under
 London are miles  miles—hundreds  miles— a few days rain
 London empty will leave  sweet  clean.  main drains are
big enough  airy enough  anyone. Then ’s cellars, vaults,
stores,  which bolting passages may be made   drains.  
railway tunnels  subways. Eh? You begin  see?  we form a
b—able-bodied, clean-minded men. We’re not going  pick up any
rubbish  drifts . Weaklings go out again.”

“ you meant   go?”

“Well—I parleyed, didn’t I?”

“We won’t quarrel about . Go on.”

“Those who stop obey orders. Able-bodied, clean-minded women we want
al—mothers  teachers. No lackadaisical ladies—no blasted rolling
eyes. We can’t have any weak  silly. Life  real again,  
useless  cumbersome  mischievous have  die.  ought  die.
 ought  be willing  die. ’s a sort  disloyalty, after all,
 live  taint  race.   can’t be happy. Moreover, dying’s
none  dreadful; ’s  funking makes  bad.   all those
places we shall gather. Our district will be London.  we may even be
able  keep a watch,  run about   open when  Martians keep
away. Play cricket, perhaps. ’s how we shall save  race. Eh?
’s a possible thing? But saving  race  nothing  itself.  I
say, ’s only being rats. ’s saving our knowledge  adding  
  thing.  men like you come . ’s books, ’s
models. We must make great safe places down deep,  get all  books
we can; not novels  poetry swipes, but ideas, science books. ’s
where men like you come . We must go   British Museum  pick
all those books through. Especially we must keep up our science—learn
more. We must watch these Martians. Some  us must go  spies. When
’s all working, perhaps I will. Get caught, I mean.   great
thing , we must leave  Martians alone. We mustn’t even steal. If
we get   way, we clear out. We must show  we mean no harm.
Yes, I know. But ’re intelligent things,   won’t hunt us
down if  have all  want,  think we’re just harmless vermin.”

 artilleryman paused  laid a brown h upon  arm.

“After all,  may not be  much we may have  learn before—Just
imagine : four  five   fighting machines suddenly starting
off—Heat-Rays right  left,  not a Martian  ’em. Not a Martian
 ’em, but men—men who have learned  way how.  may be   time,
even—those men. Fancy having one   lovely things,  
Heat-Ray wide  free! Fancy having   control! What  
matter if you smashed  smithereens   end   run, after a
bust like ? I reckon  Martians’ll open  beautiful eyes!
Can’t you see , man? Can’t you see  hurrying, hurrying—puffing
 blowing  hooting   other mechanical affairs? Something
out  gear  every case.  swish, bang, rattle, swish! Just  
are fumbling over , _swish_ comes  Heat-Ray, , behold! man has
come back  his own.”

 a while  imaginative daring   artilleryman,   tone 
assurance  courage he assumed, completely dominated  mind. I
believed unhesitatingly both  his forecast  human destiny  
 practicability  his astonishing scheme,   reader who thinks
 susceptible  foolish must contrast his position, reading steadily
 all his thoughts about his subject,  mine, crouching fearfully
  bushes  listening, distracted by apprehension. We talked 
 manner through  early morning time,  later crept out  
bushes, , after scanning  sky  Martians, hurried precipitately
  house on Putney Hill where he had made his lair.  was  coal
cellar   place,  when I saw  work he had spent a week
upon— was a burrow scarcely ten yards long, which he designed 
reach   main drain on Putney Hill—I had  first inkling  
gulf between his dreams  his powers. Such a hole I  have dug 
a day. But I believed  him sufficiently  work  him all 
morning until past midday  his digging. We had a garden barrow 
shot  earth we removed against  kitchen range. We refreshed
ourselves  a tin  mock-turtle soup  wine   neighbouring
pantry. I found a curious relief   aching strangeness  
world   steady labour.  we worked, I turned his project over 
 mind,  presently objections  doubts began  arise; but I
worked  all  morning,  glad was I  find myself  a
purpose again. After working  hour I began  speculate on 
distance one had  go before  cloaca was reached,  chances we
had  missing  altogether.  immediate trouble was why we 
dig  long tunnel, when  was possible  get in  drain 
once down one   manholes,  work back   house.  seemed 
, too,   house was inconveniently chosen,  required a
needless length  tunnel.  just  I was beginning  face these
things,  artilleryman stopped digging,  looked  .

“We’re working well,” he said. He put down his spade. “Let us knock off
a bit” he said. “I think ’s time we reconnoitred   roof  
house.”

I was  going on,  after a little hesitation he resumed his spade;
 then suddenly I was struck by a thought. I stopped,   did he
 once.

“Why  you walking about  common,” I said, “instead  being
here?”

“Taking  air,” he said. “I was coming back. ’s safer by night.”

“But  work?”

“Oh, one can’t always work,” he said,   a flash I saw  man
plain. He hesitated, holding his spade. “We ought  reconnoitre now,”
he said, “because if any come near  may hear  spades  drop
upon us unawares.”

I was no longer disposed  object. We went together   roof 
stood on a ladder peeping out   roof door. No Martians   be
seen,  we ventured out on  tiles,  slipped down under shelter
  parapet.

  position a shrubbery hid  greater portion  Putney, but
we  see  river below, a bubbly mass  red weed,   low
parts  Lambeth flooded  red.  red creeper swarmed up  trees
about  old palace,   branches stretched gaunt  dead, 
set  shrivelled leaves,  amid  clusters.  was strange how
entirely dependent both these things  upon flowing water  
propagation. About us neither had gained a footing; laburnums, pink
mays, snowballs,  trees  arbor-vitae, rose out  laurels 
hydrangeas, green  brilliant in  sunlight. Beyond Kensington
dense smoke was rising,    a blue haze hid  northward
hills.

 artilleryman began  tell    sort  people who still
remained  London.

“One night last week,” he said, “some fools got  electric light 
order,   was all Regent Street   Circus ablaze, crowded
 painted  ragged drunkards, men  women, dancing  shouting
till dawn. A man who was  told .    day came  became
aware  a fighting-machine standing near by  Langham  looking
down  . Heaven knows how long he had been .  must have
given some   a nasty turn. He came down  road towards ,
 picked up nearly a hundred too drunk  frightened  run away.”

Grotesque gleam  a time no history will ever fully describe!

 ,  answer   questions, he came round  his grandiose
plans again. He grew enthusiastic. He talked  eloquently  
possibility  capturing a fighting-machine  I more than half
believed  him again. But now  I was beginning  underst
something  his quality, I  divine  stress he laid on doing
nothing precipitately.  I noted  now  was no question 
he personally was  capture  fight  great machine.

After a time we went down   cellar. Neither  us seemed disposed
 resume digging,  when he suggested a meal, I was nothing loath.
He became suddenly very generous,  when we had eaten he went away
 returned  some excellent cigars. We lit these,  his optimism
glowed. He was inclined  regard  coming  a great occasion.

“’s some champagne   cellar,” he said.

“We can dig better on  Thames-side burgundy,” said I.

“No,” said he; “I  host today. Champagne! Great God! We’ve a heavy
enough task before us! Let us take a rest  gather strength while we
may. Look  these blistered hands!”

 pursuant   idea  a holiday, he insisted upon playing cards
after we had eaten. He taught  euchre,  after dividing London
between us, I taking  northern side  he  southern, we played
 parish points. Grotesque  foolish   will seem   sober
reader,   absolutely true,  what  more remarkable, I found 
card game  several others we played extremely interesting.

Strange mind  man! ,  our species upon  edge 
extermination  appalling degradation,  no clear prospect before
us but  chance  a horrible death, we  sit following 
chance   painted pasteboard,  playing  “joker”  vivid
delight. Afterwards he taught  poker,  I beat him  three tough
chess games. When dark came we decided  take  risk,  lit a
lamp.

After  interminable string  games, we supped,   artilleryman
finished  champagne. We went on smoking  cigars. He was no longer
 energetic regenerator  his species I had encountered  
morning. He was still optimistic, but  was a less kinetic, a more
thoughtful optimism. I remember he wound up   health, proposed 
a speech  small variety  considerable intermittence. I took a
cigar,  went upstairs  look   lights  which he had spoken
 blazed  greenly along  Highgate hills.

 first I stared unintelligently across  London valley. 
northern hills  shrouded  darkness;  fires near Kensington
glowed redly,  now  then  orange-red tongue  flame flashed up
 vanished   deep blue night. All  rest  London was black.
Then, nearer, I perceived a strange light, a pale, violet-purple
fluorescent glow, quivering under  night breeze.  a space I 
not underst ,  then I knew   must be  red weed 
which  faint irradiation proceeded.   realisation 
dormant sense  wonder,  sense   proportion  things, awoke

DEAD LONDON.


After I had parted   artilleryman, I went down  hill,  by
 High Street across  bridge  Fulham.  red weed was
tumultuous   time,  nearly choked  bridge roadway; but 
fronds  already whitened  patches by  spreading disease 
presently removed   swiftly.

  corner   lane  runs  Putney Bridge station I found a
man lying. He was  black  a sweep   black dust, alive, but
helplessly  speechlessly drunk. I  get nothing  him but

 was black dust along  roadway   bridge onwards,  
grew thicker  Fulham.  streets  horribly quiet. I got
food—sour, hard,  mouldy, but quite eatable— a baker’s shop here.
Some way towards Walham Green  streets became clear  powder,  I
passed a white terrace  houses on fire;  noise   burning was
 absolute relief. Going on towards Brompton,  streets  quiet
again.

Here I came once more upon  black powder   streets  upon
dead bodies. I saw altogether about a dozen   length   Fulham
Road.  had been dead many days,   I hurried quickly past
.  black powder covered  over,  softened  outlines.
One  two had been disturbed by dogs.

Where  was no black powder,  was curiously like a Sunday  
City,   closed shops,  houses locked up   blinds drawn,
 desertion,   stillness.  some places plunderers had been 
work, but rarely  other than  provision  wine shops. A
jeweller’s window had been broken open  one place, but apparently 
thief had been disturbed,  a number  gold chains  a watch lay
scattered on  pavement. I did not trouble  touch . Farther on
was a tattered woman  a heap on a doorstep;  h  hung over
her knee was gashed  bled down her rusty brown dress,  a smashed
magnum  champagne formed a pool across  pavement. She seemed
asleep, but she was dead.

 farther I penetrated in London,  profounder grew 
stillness. But  was not  much  stillness  death— was 
stillness  suspense,  expectation.  any time  destruction 
had already singed  northwestern borders   metropolis,  had
annihilated Ealing  Kilburn, might strike among these houses

almost imperceptibly upon  senses.  was a sobbing alternation

passed streets  ran northward  grew  volume,  houses

down Exhibition Road. I stopped, staring towards Kensington Gardens,
wondering   strange, remote wailing.  was  if  mighty
desert  houses had found a voice   fear  solitude.

“Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” wailed  superhuman note—great waves 
sound sweeping down  broad, sunlit roadway, between  tall
buildings on each side. I turned northwards, marvelling, towards 
iron gates  Hyde Park. I had half a mind  break in  Natural
History Museum  find  way up   summits   towers, 
order  see across  park. But I decided  keep   ground,
where quick hiding was possible,   went on up  Exhibition Road.
All  large mansions on each side   road  empty  still,
  footsteps echoed against  sides   houses.   top,
near  park gate, I came upon a strange sight—a bus overturned, 
 skeleton  a horse picked clean. I puzzled over   a time,
 then went on   bridge over  Serpentine.  voice grew
stronger  stronger, though I  see nothing above  housetops
on  north side   park, save a haze  smoke   northwest.

“Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” cried  voice, coming,   seemed  ,

possession  . I found I was intensely weary, footsore,  now
again hungry  thirsty.

 was already past noon. Why was I wandering alone   city  
dead? Why was I alone when all London was lying  state,   
black shroud? I felt intolerably lonely.  mind ran on old friends
 I had forgotten  years. I thought   poisons

 two sodden creatures  despair, who  far  I knew, shared 
city  myself. . . .

I came in Oxford Street by  Marble Arch,  here again  black

heat   long walk.  infinite trouble I managed  break in a
public-house  get food  drink. I was weary after eating,  went
in  parlour behind  bar,  slept on a black horsehair sofa I
found .

I awoke  find  dismal howling still   ears, “Ulla, ulla,
ulla, ulla.”  was now dusk,  after I had routed out some biscuits
 a cheese   bar— was a meat safe, but  contained nothing
but maggots—I wandered on through  silent residential squares 
Baker Street—Portman Square   only one I can name—  came out
 last upon Regent’s Park.   I emerged   top  Baker
Street, I saw far away over  trees   clearness   sunset
 hood   Martian giant  which  howling proceeded. I was
not terrified. I came upon him  if   a matter  course. I
watched him  some time, but he did not move. He appeared  be
standing  yelling,  no reason  I  discover.

I tried  formulate a plan  action.  perpetual sound  “Ulla,
ulla, ulla, ulla,” confused  mind. Perhaps I was too tired  be very
fearful. Certainly I was more curious  know  reason  
monotonous crying than afraid. I turned back away   park 
struck in Park Road, intending  skirt  park, went along under
 shelter   terraces,  got a view   stationary, howling
Martian   direction  St. John’s Wood. A couple  hundred
yards out  Baker Street I heard a yelping chorus,  saw, first a
dog  a piece  putrescent red meat  his jaws coming headlong
towards ,  then a pack  starving mongrels  pursuit  him. He
made a wide curve  avoid ,  though he feared I might prove a
fresh competitor.   yelping died away down  silent road, 
wailing sound  “Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” reasserted itself.

I came upon  wrecked handling-machine halfway  St. John’s Wood
station.  first I thought a house had fallen across  road.  was
only  I clambered among  ruins  I saw,  a start, 
mechanical Samson lying,   tentacles bent  smashed

twilight was now  far advanced   blood  which  seat was

Wondering still more  all  I had seen, I pushed on towards
Primrose Hill. Far away, through a gap   trees, I saw a second
Martian,  motionless   first, standing   park towards 
Zoological Gardens,  silent. A little beyond  ruins about 
smashed handling-machine I came upon  red weed again,  found 
Regent’s Canal, a spongy mass  dark-red vegetation.

 I crossed  bridge,  sound  “Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” ceased.

 dusky houses about  stood faint  tall  dim;  trees
towards  park  growing black. All about   red weed

Night,  mother  fear  mystery, was coming upon . But while
 voice sounded  solitude,  desolation, had been endurable; by
virtue   London had still seemed alive,   sense  life about
 had upheld . Then suddenly a change,  passing  something—I
knew not what— then a stillness   be felt. Nothing but 
gaunt quiet.

London about  gazed   spectrally.  windows   white houses
 like  eye sockets  skulls. About   imagination found a
thous noiseless enemies moving. Terror seized , a horror  
temerity.  front    road became pitchy black  though  was
tarred,  I saw a contorted shape lying across  pathway. I 
not bring myself  go on. I turned down St. John’s Wood Road,  ran
headlong   unendurable stillness towards Kilburn. I hid 
 night   silence, until long after midnight,  a cabmen’s
shelter  Harrow Road. But before  dawn  courage returned, 
while  stars  still   sky I turned once more towards
Regent’s Park. I missed  way among  streets,  presently saw
down a long avenue,   half-light   early dawn,  curve 
Primrose Hill. On  summit, towering up   fading stars, was a
third Martian, erect  motionless like  others.

save myself even  trouble  killing myself. I marched on recklessly
towards  Titan,  then,  I drew nearer   light grew, I
saw  a multitude  black birds was circling  clustering about
 hood.    heart gave a bound,  I began running along 
road.

I hurried through  red weed  choked St. Edmund’s Terrace (I
waded breast-high across a torrent  water  was rushing down 
 waterworks towards  Albert Road),  emerged upon  grass
before  rising   sun. Great mounds had been heaped about 
crest   hill, making a huge redoubt  — was  final 
largest place  Martians had made—  behind these heaps 
rose a thin smoke against  sky. Against  sky line  eager dog
ran  disappeared.  thought  had flashed in  mind grew
real, grew credible. I felt no fear, only a wild, trembling exultation,
 I ran up  hill towards  motionless monster. Out   hood
hung lank shreds  brown,  which  hungry birds pecked  tore.

 another moment I had scrambled up  earthen rampart  stood upon
 crest,   interior   redoubt was below . A mighty space
 was,  gigantic machines here   within , huge mounds 
material  strange shelter places.  scattered about , some 
 overturned war-machines, some   now rigid handling-machines,
 a dozen   stark  silent  laid  a row,  
Martians—_dead_!—slain by  putrefactive  disease bacteria against
which  systems  unprepared; slain   red weed was being
slain; slain, after all man’s devices had failed, by  humblest
things  God,  his wisdom, has put upon  earth.

  incomprehensible  any death  be.   al   time
 death was incomprehensible. All I knew was  these things

believed   destruction  Sennacherib had been repeated, 
God had repented,   Angel  Death had slain    night.

I stood staring in  pit,   heart lightened gloriously, even
  rising sun struck  world  fire about   his rays. 
pit was still  darkness;  mighty engines,  great  wonderful
  power  complexity,  unearthly   tortuous forms,
rose weird  vague  strange out   shadows towards  light.
A multitude  dogs, I  hear, fought over  bodies  lay

I turned  looked down  slope   hill  where, enhaloed now

All about  pit,  saved  by a miracle  everlasting

Eastward, over  blackened ruins   Albert Terrace

Northward  Kilburn  Hampsted, blue  crowded  houses;

WRECKAGE.


 now comes  strangest thing   story. Yet, perhaps,   not
altogether strange. I remember, clearly  coldly  vividly, all
 I did  day until  time  I stood weeping  praising
God upon  summit  Primrose Hill.  then I forget.

Of  next three days I know nothing. I have learned since , 
far   being  first discoverer   Martian overthrow,
several such wanderers  myself had already discovered  on 
previous night. One man— first—had gone  St. Martin’s-le-Gr,
, while I sheltered   cabmen’s hut, had contrived  telegraph
 Paris. Thence  joyful news had flashed all over  world; a
thous cities, chilled by ghastly apprehensions, suddenly flashed
in frantic illuminations;  knew    Dublin, Edinburgh,
Manchester, Birmingham,   time when I stood upon  verge  
pit. Already men, weeping  joy,  I have heard, shouting 
staying  work  shake hands  shout,  making up trains,
even  near  Crewe,  descend upon London.  church bells 
had ceased a fortnight since suddenly caught  news, until all
Engl was bell-ringing. Men on cycles, lean-faced, unkempt, scorched
along every country lane shouting  unhoped deliverance, shouting 
gaunt, staring figures  despair.    food! Across 
Channel, across  Irish Sea, across  Atlantic, corn, bread, 
meat  tearing  our relief. All  shipping   world seemed
going Londonward  those days. But  all  I have no memory. I
drifted—a demented man. I found myself  a house  kindly people, who
had found  on  third day wandering, weeping,  raving through
 streets  St. John’s Wood.  have told  since  I was
singing some insane doggerel about “ Last Man Left Alive! Hurrah!
 Last Man Left Alive!” Troubled      own affairs,
these people, whose name, much  I  like  express  gratitude

 , sheltered ,  protected   myself. Apparently

imprisoned  had been destroyed,  every soul  , by a Martian.
He had swept  out  existence,   seemed, without any
provocation,  a boy might crush  ant hill,   mere wantonness

I was a lonely man,    very kind  . I was a lonely man
 a sad one,   bore  . I remained   four days
after  recovery. All  time I felt a vague, a growing craving 
look once more on whatever remained   little life  seemed

upon  misery.  dissuaded .  did all    divert

confess,  these four-day friends  tears, I went out again in

Already   busy  returning people;  places even

everywhere, busied  a thous activities,   seemed incredible

then I noticed how yellow   skins   people I met, how
shaggy  hair   men, how large  bright  eyes,  
every other man still wore his dirty rags.  faces seemed all 
one  two expressions—a leaping exultation  energy  a grim
resolution. Save   expression   faces, London seemed a city
 tramps.  vestries  indiscriminately distributing bread sent
us by  French government.  ribs   few horses showed
dismally. Haggard special constables  white badges stood  
corners  every street. I saw little   mischief wrought by 
Martians until I reached Wellington Street,   I saw  red
weed clambering over  buttresses  Waterloo Bridge.

sense  doubt  insecurity   mind. I sit   study writing by
lamplight,  suddenly I see again  healing valley below set 
writhing flames,  feel  house behind  about  empty 
desolate. I go out in  Byfleet Road,  vehicles pass , a
butcher boy  a cart, a cabful  visitors, a workman on a bicycle,
children going  school,  suddenly  become vague  unreal,
 I hurry again   artilleryman through  hot, brooding
silence. Of a night I see  black powder darkening  silent
streets,   contorted bodies shrouded   layer;  rise
upon  tattered  dog-bitten.  gibber  grow fiercer, paler,
uglier, mad distortions  humanity  last,  I wake, cold 
wretched,   darkness   night.

I go  London  see  busy multitudes  Fleet Street  
Str,   comes across  mind   are but  ghosts  
past, haunting  streets  I have seen silent  wretched, going
  fro, phantasms  a dead city,  mockery  life  a
galvanised body.  strange, too,    st on Primrose Hill, 
I did but a day before writing  last chapter,  see  great
province  houses, dim  blue through  haze   smoke 
mist, vanishing  last in  vague lower sky,  see  people
walking   fro among  flower beds on  hill,  see 
sight-seers about  Martian machine  stands  still,  hear
 tumult  playing children,   recall  time when I saw 
all bright  clear-cut, hard  silent, under  dawn   last
great day. . . .

 strangest  all    hold  wife’s h again,   think
 I have counted her,   she has counted , among  dead.
